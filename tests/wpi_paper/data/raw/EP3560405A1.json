The spray.arm holder coupler.356 formed at the lower part of the.spray arm.200 is inserted into the rim-shaped.body.910 of the.linker.900..In this example, the first and the second.main links.920a and 920b of the.linker.900 may be coupled to the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b in a linearly reciprocating manner. The first and the second.auxiliary links.950a and 950b of the.linker.900 may be coupled to the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b to rotate the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b according to reciprocating motion of the.linker.900. The.eccentric gear protrusion.830 is inserted into the.eccentric gear container.940 formed at the second.main link.920b, such that the.eccentric gear.800 may be supported by and be rotatably provided at the lower part of the.main arm.300..Then, the fixed.gear.500 may be rotatably coupled to the spray.arm holder coupler.356 formed at the lower part of the.spray arm.200 in an inserted manner. In this example, the.eccentric gear.800 supported by the.eccentric gear container.940 of the second.main link.920b may be coupled to the gears formed at the fixed.gear.500 in an engagement manner, such that the.eccentric gear.800 may rotate and revolve along the outer circumferential surface of the fixed.gear.500 according to rotation of the.main arm.300..In some implementations, the.flow path converter.700 is inserted into the spray.arm holder coupler.356. The.flow path converter.700 may be accommodated in the.main arm inserter.610 provided at the.spray arm holder.600..As the wash water is introduced into the.main arm inserter.610, the.flow path converter.700 ascends to the.main arm inserter.610 by travel pressure of the wash water. Upon stoppage of the wash water, as internal water pressure of the.main arm inserter.610 decreases, the.flow path converter.700 descends..In addition, the.spray arm holder.600 is coupled to the lower part of the spray.arm holder coupler.356. Accordingly, separation of the fixed.gear.500 from the spray.arm holder coupler.356 due to the.spray arm holder.600 may be prevented..Sequentially, while being inserted into the.sump inserter.630 formed at the lower part of the.spray arm.600, the.fasteners.530 of the fixed.gear.500 is coupled to the.coupling bosses.51 of the.sump cover.50 and the.fixer gear.500 is fixed to the.sump cover.50 by a separate fastener..That is, the fixed.gear.500 is rotatably coupled to the spray.arm holder coupler.356 of the.spray arm.200 before the.spray arm holder.600 is coupled to and is fixed to the.spray arm.200 at the lower part of the fixed.gear.500. Then, the.spray arm holder.600 is rotatably seated at the spray arm.holder seating part.53 of the.sump cover.50 and the fixed.gear.500 is fixed to the.sump cover.50..Accordingly, the fixed.gear.500 of the elements of the.spray arm assembly.100 is fixed to the.sump cover.50, alone. The.spray arm.200, the.spray arm holder.600, and the.linker.900 of the.spray arm assembly.100 are rotatably provided at the.sump cover.50. In this example, upward movement of the.spray arm holder.600 may be limited by the fixed.gear.500, thereby being prevented from separating from the spray.arm seating part.53..In this example, operation of the.spray arm assembly.100 will be briefly explained..First, the wash water introduced through the.water pipe.80 moves to the sump using the separate water supply pump and is introduced into the.spray arm assembly.100 through the.water hole.59 formed at the spray arm.holder seating part.53 of the.sump cover.50. The wash water introduced into the.spray arm assembly.100 may be sprayed onto the objects to be washed through the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b or the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b..In this example, the.spray arm.200 may be rotated in a direction opposite to a spraying direction of the wash water by driving force according to the wash water sprayed by the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b or the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b..In this example, supply of the wash water to the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b or the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b may be changed by operation of water flow path conversion of the.flow path converter.70 according to supply or stoppage of the wash water using the water supply pump..In some implementations, as the.spray arm.200 rotates, the.eccentric gear.800 provided at the lower part of the.main arm.300 rotates and revolves along the outer circumferential surface of the fixed.gear.500. That is, in the state where the fixed.gear.500 is fixed to the.sump cover.50, the fixed.gear.50 maintains the fixed state regardless of rotation of the.spray arm.200. In the state where the.eccentric gear.800 is rotatably coupled to the.main arm.300, the.eccentric gear.800 is geared to the fixed.gear.500 such that the.eccentric gear.800 may revolve along the outer circumferential surface of the fixed.gear.500 according to rotation of the.main arm.300..In some implementations, the.eccentric protrusion.830 of the.eccentric gear.800 is inserted into the second main link 830b of the.linker.900. The.eccentric protrusion.830 performs a circular motion with respect to the center of the rotation to have a certain interval according to rotation of the.eccentric gear.800. Thus, the.linker.900 into which the.eccentric protrusion.830 is inserted linearly reciprocates due to rotation of the.eccentric protrusion.830 at the lower part of the.main arm.300..In this example, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are connected to the first and the second.auxiliary links.950a and 950b of the.linker.900. The first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b connected to first and the second.auxiliary links.950a and 950b reciprocally rotates according to the reciprocating motion of the.linker.900 such that a spraying angle of the wash water sprayed from the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b may be changed..In this example, each configuration of the.spray arm assembly.100 will be described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing..First, the.main arm.300, i.e. a main configuration of the.spray arm assembly.100, will be described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing..FIG. 5.illustrates an example main arm..As illustrated in.FIG. 5., the.main arm.300 may include the first and the.second arms.300a and 300b having an asymmetric structure while extending in opposite directions, respectively, and the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d between the first and the.second arms.300a and 300b while inclinedly extending at a certain angle with respect to the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b. In this example, the first and the second.auxiliary arms connectors.330a and 330b, which are rotatably coupled to the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b, may be formed at the ends of the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d, respectively..In some implementations, the flow path for transferring the wash water in the.main arm.300 may be formed by the main arm.upper housing.310 for forming the upper part of the.main arm.300 and the main arm.lower housing.340..In this example, in the main arm.upper housing.310, the first and the second upper.main arms.312a and 312b forming the upper part of the first and the second.main arm.300a and 300b and first and the second.upper extensions.322a and 322b for forming the upper part of the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d are formed..In addition, in the main arm.lower housing.340, the first and the second lower.main arms.341a and 341b forming the lower part of the first and the second.main arm.300a and 300b and first and the second.lower extensions.351a and 351b for forming the lower part of the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d are formed. In this example, the first and the second.auxiliary arm connectors.330a and 330b and the first and the second upper.main arms.312a and 312b may be formed at the ends of the first and the second.main arms.312a and 312b in an integrated manner..In this example, an angle between the first.main arm.300a (or the second.main arm.300b) and the.first extension.300c (or the.second extension.300d) may be an obtuse angle D2. An angle between the first.main arm.300a (or the second.main arm.300b) and the.second extension.300d (or the.first extension.300c) may be an acute angle D1..That is, a certain angle between a central line passing through a center of the first and the.second arms.300a and 300b and a central line passing through a center of the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d may be formed at the center of rotation..In this example, since the obtuse angle D2 between the first and the second.main arms.300a, 300b and the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d is formed, a detachment space of the.filter.70 and the.filter cover.60 which are provided at the lower part of the.spray arm.200 may be secured..However, if the detachment space is secured regardless of the angle between the first and the second.main arms.300a, 300b and the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d, the angle between the first and the second.main arms.300a, 300b and the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d may be varied..In some implementations, the angle between the first and the second.main arms.300a, 300b and the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d may be a right angle. Various modifications thereof are possible according to design change of the.main arm.300. The angle between the first and the second.main arms.300a, 300b and the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d is not limited thereto..Furthermore, the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b may be asymmetrically formed with respect to the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d. However, the forming state of the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b is not limited thereto. The first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b may be symmetrically formed respect to the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d..As illustrated, the.main arm.300 may form the flow path for transferring the wash water by coupling the main arm.upper housing.310 to the main arm.lower housing.340..FIG. 6.illustrates an example main arm in.FIG. 5. FIG. 6.illustrates a cross-sectional view along a line A'-A\" in.FIG. 5...As illustrated in.FIG. 6., the.main arm.300 may be formed by coupling the main arm.upper housing.310 to the main arm.lower housing.340. In this example, the main arm.upper housing.310 and the main arm.lower housing.340 may be integrated using heat/ultrasonic welding..Thus, the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b of the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d of the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d may be formed at the lower surface of the main arm.upper housing.310. In addition,.welding ribs.327 are formed at to the main arm.lower housing.340 to be welded..In addition, in the upper surface of the main arm.lower housing.340, welding steps 357, at which the.welding ribs.327 is welded, having a shape corresponding to the.welding ribs.327 are formed along outer circumferential surfaces of the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b of the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 305 of the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d. The.welding ribs.327 and the welding steps 357 will be described in detail when the main arm.upper housing.310 and the main arm.lower housing.340 are described..Hereinafter, the main arm.upper housing.310 of the.main arm.300 will be described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing..Again, referring to.FIG. 5., an upper shape of the main arm.upper housing.310 will be explained..As illustrated in.FIG. 5., a first.inclined surface.313a having a downward slope in an opposite direction to a rotation direction of the.spray arm.200 may be formed at the upper surface of the first upper.main arm.312a of the main arm.upper housing.310. A second.inclined surface.313b having a downward slope in an opposite direction to a rotation direction of the.spray arm.200 may be formed at the upper surface of the second upper.main arm.312b..In this example, the first and the second.inclined surfaces.313a and 313b may be extended to the first and the second.upper extensions.322a and 322b to have inclinedly curved shapes. The first and the second.inclined surfaces.313a and 313b may be formed in order to widen a range of spraying angles of a plurality of the.nozzles.314a, 315a, 314b, 315b formed at the first upper.main arm.312a and the second upper.main arm.312b..In some implementations, the.first nozzles.314a spraying the wash water in a vertical direction of the.spray arm.200 and first.inclined nozzles.315a inclinedly formed in an opposite direction to a rotation direction of the.spray arm.200 to generate driving force which allows the.spray arm.200 to be capable of rotating may be formed at the first.inclined surface.313a..Furthermore,.second nozzles.314b spraying the wash water in a vertical direction of the.spray arm.200 and second.inclined nozzles.315b inclinedly formed in an opposite direction to a rotation direction of the.spray arm.200 to generate driving force which allows the.spray arm.200 to be capable of rotating may be formed at the second.inclined surface.313b..In this example, the first and the.second nozzles.314a and 314b and the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b may be formed to have different radiuses or to have different sprayed areas, with respect to the center of rotation of the main arm.upper housing.310..In some implementations, in the case of the first and the.second nozzles.314a and 314b and the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b, the quantity thereof may be increased or decreased in order to secure the sprayed areas of the wash water and to form of driving force for rotation of the.spray arm.200. Forming positions and spray directions may be varied..Furthermore, the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b may be formed to have various spray angles in order to secure washing areas. However, the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b may be formed to have the total of driving force due to the wash water sprayed from the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b may be equal to or greater than minimum driving force for rotation of the.spray arm.200..In addition, an.upper marker.317a having a certain figure or character shape may be formed at a surface of the first upper.main arm.312a to check a welding direction of the main arm.upper housing.310 upon welding of the main.upper housing.310 and the main arm.lower housing.340..Furthermore, a separate.central nozzle.317b may be further formed at the center of rotation of the first upper.main arm.312a or the second upper.main arm.312b to spray the wash water to the center of rotation of the.main arm.300. In this example, since the nozzles formed at the first and the second upper.main arms.312a and 312b are uniformly distributed, the.central nozzle.317b may be formed at one side of the first upper.main arm.312a or the second upper.main arm.312b..The first and the second.auxiliary arm connectors.330a and 330b supporting the first and the second.auxiliary arm.400a and 400b are rotatably formed at the first and the second.upper extensions.322a and 322b. First and the.second ports.324a and 324b are formed at the ends of the first and the second.upper extensions.322a and 322b to communicate with the first and the second.auxiliary arm connectors.330a and 330b..In some implementations, separate first and the second.central nozzles.326a and 326b may be further formed at centers of rotation of the first and the second.upper extensions.322a and 332b in order to spray the wash water to the center of rotation of the.main arm.300. In this example, in the case of the first and the.second extensions.322a and 322b, since the.nozzles.414a, 415a, 414b, 415b, 422a, 422b are formed at the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b only(see.FIG. 12.), a small amount of wash water may be sprayed onto the centers of the first and the.second extensions.322a and 322b. Thus, the separate first and the second.central nozzles.326a and 326b may be further formed at the first and the second.upper extensions.322a and 322b..In addition, the first and the second.central nozzles.326a and 326b may be formed to have different radiuses at the center of rotation of the.main arm.300. The first and the second.central nozzles.326a and 326b may be formed in different shapes in order to have different washing efficiency. For example, the first central nozzle 326a may be formed to have a slot shape. The second.central nozzle.326b may be formed to have a circular shape..FIG. 7.illustrates an example upper housing of the main arm in.FIGS. 5-6...In some implementations, as illustrated in.FIG. 7., the.welding ribs.327 for being welding to the main arm.lower housing.340 are formed at the lower part of the upper.main arm.310. Herein the.welding ribs.327 are formed to extend to define the first and the second.main arms.312a and 312b and the first and the second.upper extensions.322a and 322b, thereby forming the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d..In addition, a cross-shaped upper flow.path formation rib.328 is formed at the center of rotation of the main arm.upper housing.310 to define the flow path, such that wash water may be introduced into the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d through the main arm.lower housing.340, which will be described below..In some implementations, in the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d, a plurality of ribs may be formed inside the.welding ribs.327 to guide the flow path of wash water moving to the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d..In this example, the first and the second.upper ribs.316a and 316b formed at the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b may be protruded from the upper flow.path formation rib.328 to insides of the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b. The first and the second.upper ribs.316a and 316b may be provided to be in contact with first and the second.lower ribs.324a and 342b formed at the main arm.lower housing.340, which will be described below, in order to form the flow paths..Furthermore, the first and the second extension.upper ribs.325a and 325b formed at the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d may be protruded from the upper flow.path formation rib.328 to insides of the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d. The first and the second extension.upper ribs.325a and 325b may be provided to be in contact with first and the second extension.lower ribs.352a and 352b formed at the main arm.lower housing.340, which will be described below, in order to form the flow paths..In some implementations, in the case of the first and the second extension.upper ribs.325a and 325b formed at the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301c, the first and the second extension.upper ribs.325a and 325b may be inclined to correspond to the shapes of the first and the.second ports.324a and 324b such that the wash water flowing through the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d may be smoothly introduced into the first and the.second ports.324a and 324b formed at the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d..The first and the second.auxiliary arm connectors.330a and 330b and the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d are formed at the ends of the first and the second.upper extensions.322a and 322b in an integrated manner. The first and the second.auxiliary arm connectors.330a and 300b are formed in opposite directions to each other while having the same shape. Hereinafter, only the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a formed at the first.upper extension.322a will be described below..FIG. 8.illustrates an example auxiliary arm connector of the main arm in.FIGS. 5-6...As illustrated in.FIG. 8., the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a includes an extending.pipe.331 communicating with the.first port.324a of the first.upper extension.322a, and an.auxiliary flow.334 communicating with an end of the extending.pipe.331 and converting the flow path of the wash water upwards, and a.shaft.338 extending at an end of the auxiliary flow path guide 334 to rotatably supporting the first.auxiliary arm.400a..In this example, a plurality of sealing.ribs.332a, 332b, 332c are provided between the extending.pipe.331 and the first.auxiliary arm.400a to seal water leaking. For example, the sealing.ribs.332a, 332b, 332c can have ring shapes. Flow.path forming protrusions.333a are provided between the extending.pipe.331 and the auxiliary flow path guide 334. The auxiliary flow path guide 334 introduces a part of the wash water into the extending.pipe.331. In some implementations, the flow.path forming protrusions.333a can be provided on an outer circumferential surface of the extending.pipe.331. The flow.path forming protrusions.333a can be symmetrically provided on the surface of the extending.pipe.331..In this example, the sealing.ribs.332a, 332b, 332c and the flow.path forming protrusions.333a may be symmetrically formed at an inner circumferential surface of the first.auxiliary arm.400a. That is, when the sealing.ribs.332a, 332b, 332c and the flow.path forming protrusions.333a completely adhere to the first.auxiliary arm.400a, rotation of the first.auxiliary arm.400a may be restricted by frictional force. Thus, a space between the first.auxiliary arm.400a, and the sealing.ribs.332a, 332b, 332c and the flow.path forming protrusions.333a may be formed such that the first.auxiliary arm.400a can rotate..In some implementations, a space between a pair of sealing ribs of the sealing.ribs.332a, 332b, and 332c may be equal to or greater than a width of each foreign.substance discharge hole.419a (see.FIG. 13.) formed at the first.auxiliary arm.400a, which will be described below..In this example, in the case of the foreign.substance discharge holes.419a of the first.auxiliary arm.400a, when the wash water is introduced into the first.auxiliary arm.400a, the wash water may be partially introduced by pressure of the wash water between the extending.pipe.331 and the first.auxiliary arm.400a through the flow.path forming protrusion.333a, and the introduced wash water may discharge the foreign substances introduced between the extending.pipe.331 and the first auxiliary arm 440a through the foreign.substance discharge hole.419a..In addition, an upper supporting.protrusion.333b and a lower supporting protrusion 333c are protruded at a front upper surface and a rear lower surface of the extending.pipe.331. The upper supporting.protrusion.333b and the lower supporting protrusion 333c prevent the.sealing ribs.332a, 332b, and 332c and the flow.path forming protrusions.333a from being damaged by insertion error when the extending.pipe.331 is inserted into the first auxiliary arm 440a, or from being damaged when the.spray arm assembly.100 moves in the state where the.auxiliary arm.400a is coupled to the.spray arm assembly.100..The upper supporting.protrusion.333b and the lower supporting protrusion 333c are formed to have the same heights as the sealing.ribs.332a, 332b, and 332c or the flow.path forming protrusions.333a or to have comparatively large areas, such that the upper supporting.protrusion.333b and the lower supporting protrusion 333c may be formed to have higher strength than sealing.ribs.332a, 332b, and 332c or the flow.path forming protrusions.333a..The auxiliary flow path guide 334 may extend from the end of the extending.pipe.331 and may be formed to have a drum-shaped body with an open upper part and having a certain length. The auxiliary flow path guide 334 is formed to allow a direction of the wash water passing through the extending.pipe.331 to be changed upwards, such that the wash water flows to the.nozzles.414a, 415a, and 422a of the first.auxiliary arm.400a..A flow.path formation rib.335a extending in a longitudinal direction of the auxiliary flow path guide 334 may be further provided in the auxiliary flow path guide 334. To reinforce the auxiliary flow path guide 334, the flow.path formation rib.335a may extend in a vertical direction in the auxiliary flow path guide 334 to maintain a shape of the auxiliary flow path guide 334. In addition, the flow.path formation rib.335a may allow inner volume of the auxiliary flow path guide 334 to be decreased such that pressure of the wash water passing through the auxiliary flow path guide 334 may be temporarily increased..In some implementations, an.inclined part.335b may be formed at a front end of the flow.path formation rib.335a (i.e. the extending.pipe.331 side) to prevent the foreign substances from becoming stuck in the flow.path formation rib.335a when the wash water introduced into the extending.pipe.331 with the foreign substances is introduced into the flow.path formation rib.335a..Furthermore, a plurality of horizontal reinforcing.ribs.337a may be formed at both sides of the auxiliary flow path guide 334 to reinforce the auxiliary flow path guide 334 from horizontal impact applied to the auxiliary flow path guide 334. A plurality of vertical reinforcing.ribs.336a may be formed at the upper part and the lower part of the auxiliary flow path guide 334 to reinforce the auxiliary flow path guide 334 from vertical impact and load applied to the auxiliary flow path guide 334..In this example, in impact applied to the auxiliary flow path guide 334, vertical impact and load may be more greatly applied to the auxiliary flow path guide 334 than horizontal impact and load. Thus, there may be more vertical reinforcing.ribs.336a than horizontal reinforcing.ribs.337a..Furthermore, the vertical reinforcing.ribs.336a and the horizontal reinforcing.ribs.337a may be formed nearby an inner circumferential surface of the first auxiliary arm 440a. Thus, the vertical reinforcing.ribs.336a and the horizontal reinforcing.ribs.337a allow inner volume of the first auxiliary arm 440a to be decreased such that pressure of the wash water supplied to the first auxiliary arm 440a is temporarily increased, in the manner of the flow.path formation rib.335a..In some implementations, a plurality of.depressed grooves.336b and 337b may be formed at outsides of the vertical reinforcing.ribs.336a and the horizontal reinforcing.ribs.337a to prevent interference with the nozzles formed at the first.auxiliary arm.400a..For example, since the vertical reinforcing.ribs.336a and the horizontal reinforcing.ribs.337a are inserted into the first.auxiliary arm.400a and are formed adjacent to the inner circumferential surface of the first.auxiliary arm.400a, the.nozzles.414a, 415a, and 422a formed at the first.auxiliary arm.400a may be closed by the vertical reinforcing.ribs.336a and the horizontal reinforcing.ribs.337a upon rotation of the first.auxiliary arm.400a..Thus, a plurality of.depressed grooves.336b and 337b may be further formed at the outsides of the vertical reinforcing.ribs.336a and the horizontal reinforcing.ribs.337a such that the wash water may be introduced into the.nozzles.414a, 415a, and 422a upon rotation of the first auxiliary arm..The.shaft.338 is protruded from an end of the auxiliary flow path guide 334 to be inserted into an inner end of the first.auxiliary arm.400a to rotatably support the first.auxiliary arm.400a. The.shaft.338 may be formed at a position spaced apart from the extending.pipe.331 to disperse load applied to the first.auxiliary arm.400a..In some implementations, an.insertion key.338a is protruded at one side of an end of the.shaft.338. The.insertion key.338a is inserted into a.key groove.417a (see.FIG 14.) formed at the first.auxiliary arm.400a to prevent the first.auxiliary arm.400a from being separated from the shaft338. To this end, in the state where the first.auxiliary arm.400a is normally installed, the.insertion key.338a and the.key groove.417a may be provided at opposite directions to each other..For example, when the first.auxiliary arm.400a is coupled to the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a, the first.auxiliary arm.400a is inserted in reverse such that the.insertion key.338a of the.shaft.338 may be reversely inserted into the.key groove.417a of the first.auxiliary arm.400a. After being completely inserted into the first.auxiliary arm.400a, the first.auxiliary arm.400a turns in reverse, again such that the.insertion key.338a of the.shaft.338 cannot be separated from the.key groove.417a..Hereinafter, the main arm.lower housing.340 of the.main arm.300 will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings..FIG. 9.is a diagram illustrating an example lower housing of the main arm in.FIGS. 5-6...FIG. 10.is a diagram illustrating an example lower housing of the main arm in.FIGS. 5-6...As illustrated in.FIGS. 9 and 10., the main arm.lower housing.340 as described above includes the first and the second lower.main arms.341a and 341b for forming the lower parts of the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b, and the first and the second.lower extensions.351a and 351b for forming the lower parts of the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d. A spray.arm holder coupler.356 is protruded at the lower part of the center of rotation of the main arm.lower housing.340..In this example, shapes of the first and the second lower.main arms.341a and 341b and the first and the second.lower extensions.351a and 351b are formed to correspond to those of the first and the second upper.main arms.312a and 312b and the first and the second.upper extensions.322a and 322b, respectively. The detailed description of formation directions of the first and the second lower.main arms.341a and 341b and the first and the second.lower extensions.351a and 351b is omitted..In some implementations, the welding steps 357, to which the.welding ribs.327 of the main arm.upper housing.310 is welded, is formed at the upper surface of the main arm.lower housing.340, as illustrated in.FIG. 9.. In this example, the welding steps 357 is extended to define the first and the second lower.main arms.341a and 341b and the first and the second extensions 531a and 531b in order to form the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d..A cross-shaped lower flow.path formation rib.354 is formed at the central part of the spray.arm holder coupler.356 to define the flow paths, such that the wash water may be introduced into the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d..In some implementations, in the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d, a plurality of.lower ribs.342a, 342b, 352a, and 352b may be formed at an inside of the welding steps 357 (i.e. an inside for forming each flow path) to be in contact with the.upper ribs.316a, 316b, 325a, and 325b of the main arm.upper housing.310, respectively in order to guide the flow path of the wash water moving through the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d..First and the second.lower ribs.342a and 342b may be protruded from the lower flow.path formation rib.335a to the inside of the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b while being in contact with the first and the second.upper ribs.316a and 316b formed at the main arm.upper housing.310 to form the first and the.second flow paths.301a and 301b..Furthermore, the first and the second extension.lower ribs.352a and 352b may be protruded from the lower flow.path formation rib.335a to the inside of the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d while in contact with the first and the second extension.upper ribs.325a and 325b to form the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d..In some implementations, in the case of the first and the second extension.lower ribs.352a and 352b formed at the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d, the first and the second extension.lower ribs.352a and 352b formed at the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d may be inclined to correspond to the shapes of the first and the.second ports.324a and 324b such that the wash water flowing through the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d may be smoothly introduced into the first and the.second ports.324a and 324b formed at the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d..200The spray.arm holder coupler.356 is formed to have a cylindrical shape. Spray arm.holder coupler protrusions.356a are protruded at both lower parts of an outer circumferential surface of the spray.arm holder coupler.356. In the spray.arm holder coupler.356, the.main arm inserter.610 of the.spray arm holder.600 is inserted into the spray.arm holder coupler.356. When the.spray arm holder.600 in an inserted state is rotated in one direction, the.spray arm holder.600 may be held at the spray arm.holder coupler protrusions.356a such that the.spray arm holder.600 may be fixed. When the.spray arm holder.600 in an inserted state is rotated in the other direction, the.spray arm holder.600 may be separated from the spray arm.holder coupler protrusions.356a such that the.spray arm holder.600 may be separated..In some implementations, the spray.arm holder coupler.356 is formed at the main arm.lower housing.340, as illustrated in.FIG. 1.. The lower flow.path formation rib.354 is formed at an inside of the spray.arm holder coupler.356. The inside of the spray.arm holder coupler.356 is divided by the lower flow.path formation rib.354 to define first and the second main.flow path inlets.354a and 354b and first and the second extension.flow path inlets.354c and 354d such that the wash water may be introduced into the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d..In this example, the first and the second main.flow path inlets.354a and 354b and the first and the second extension.flow path inlets.354c and 354d may communicate with the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d, respectively. The first and the second main.flow path inlets.354a and 354b and the first and the second extension.flow path inlets.354c and 354d may be sequentially opened or closed by the.flow path converter.700, while will be described below..In some implementations, a.washing nozzle.343a for spraying the wash water to the rotation shaft of the.spray arm assembly.100 is formed at an end of the first lower.main arm.341a. Upon rotation of the.spray arm.200, the.washing nozzle.343a sprays the wash water to the rotation shaft, such that residual foreign substances at the lower part of the.washing tub.10 and the.sump cover.50 may be introduced into the.filter cover.60 and the.filter.70..Furthermore, a.lower marker.344a having a certain figure or character shape may be formed at a central part of the first lower.main arm.341a to check a welding direction of the main arm.lower housing.340 upon welding of the main.upper housing.310 and the main arm.lower housing.340..In some implementations, the first and the.second guide protrusions.345a and 345b are protruded at the first and the second lower.main arms.341a and 341b, to which where the first and the second.main links.920a and 920b are coupled to reciprocate. Since the first and the.second guide protrusions.345a and 345b are movably coupled to the first and the second.main links.920a and 920b of the.linker.900, the first and the second extension steps 346a and 346b are formed at the first and the.second guide protrusions.345a and 345b to prevent the first and the second.main links.920a and 920b from being separated. In addition, a.gear rotation shaft.347b rotatably coupled to the.eccentric gear.800 is protruded at the second lower.main arm.341b..In this example, the.linker.900 movably coupled to the first and the.second guide protrusion.345a and 345b performs reciprocating motion along the first and the.second guide protrusions.345a and 345b according to rotation of the.eccentric gear.800 coupled to the.gear rotation shaft.347b. Furthermore, movement of the.linker.900 in the state where the.spray arm holder.600 is inserted into the rim-shaped.body.910 may be restricted by the.spray arm holder.600..Thus, the.gear rotation shaft.347b coupling the first and the.second guide protrusions.345a and 345b for guiding movement of the.linker.900 to the.eccentric gear.800, and the center of the.spray arm holder.600 inserted into the.linker.900 may be collinear..In some implementations, a plurality of.drain lines.356b extending between the first and the second lower.main arms.341a and 341b, and the first and the second.lower extensions.351a and 351b may be formed at an outer circumferential surface of the spray.arm holder coupler.356. The.drain lines.356b may be formed at the lower surface of the main arm.lower housing.340 along the welding steps 357 formed at the upper surface of the main arm.lower housing.340..In the.drain lines.356b, upon rotation of the.spray arm.200, the residual foreign substances and the wash water at the lower surface of the main arm.lower housing.340 are discharged from the main arm.lower housing.340 by centrifugal force due to rotation of the.spray arm.200..Hereinafter, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400 and 400b which are main components of the.spray arm assembly.100 will be explained in detail with reference to accompanying drawings..FIGS. 11-14.illustrate an example auxiliary arm..FIG. 14.illustrates cross-sectional views taken along lines B'-B\" and C'-C\" in.FIG. 13., respectively..In some implementations, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b have almost identical structures. There are differences in formation positions and shapes of a plurality of.nozzles.414a, 415a, 414b, 415b, 422a, and 422b. Accordingly, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are not separately described. The first.auxiliary arm.400a will be representatively described below. A different structure of the second.auxiliary arm.400b from that of the first.auxiliary arm.400a may be added when describing the first.auxiliary arm.400a..As illustrated in.FIGS. 11.and.12., the first.auxiliary arm.400a includes an.auxiliary arm housing.410a rotatably coupled to the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a while spraying the wash water supplied from the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a according to operation of the linker 900 (see.FIG. 43.), and a.decorative panel.430a coupled to an upper part of the.auxiliary arm housing.410a to form the upper surface of the.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b..The.auxiliary arm housing.410a includes an auxiliary arm.flow path part.411a having a cylindrical shape while including an auxiliary arm flow path 412a into which the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a is inserted, and.extension ribs.423a (see.FIG. 36.) provided at the upper side of the auxiliary arm.flow path part.411a while extending in a longitudinal direction at both sides of the auxiliary arm.flow path part.411a, corresponding to an appearance of the.first extension.300c, and having symmetric shapes..In this example, the.extension ribs.423a may be symmetric with respect to a longitudinal direction of the upper surface of the auxiliary arm.flow path part.411a and may be formed to be bent downwards with respect to the auxiliary arm.flow path part.411a while extending in a longitudinal direction at both sides of the auxiliary arm.flow path part.411a. The.decorative panel.430a may be fixed and supported at outer sides of the.extension ribs.423a..In some implementations, the first.auxiliary nozzles.414a for spraying the wash water substantially perpendicular to the first.auxiliary arm.400a, and first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415a inclinedly formed in a direction opposite to a rotation direction of the first.auxiliary arm.400a to generate driving force capable of rotating the.spray arm.200 when the wash water is sprayed by the first.auxiliary arm.400a may be formed at the upper side of the auxiliary arm.flow path part.411a..The.decorative panel.430a formed to cover the upper surface of the.auxiliary arm housing.410a may have a certain thickness and include a polished metallic plate. The.decorative panel.430a may be press-molded to correspond to the upper surface shape of the.auxiliary arm housing.410a..In some implementations, in an inside of the.decorative panel.430a, a plurality of through.holes.431a, 431b, and 431c are formed at positions corresponding to the first.auxiliary nozzles.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415a to expose the first.auxiliary nozzles.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415a..In addition, upon mounting the.decorative panel.430a, a plurality of fixing.pins.434a, which is held at the extension ribs 423 of the.auxiliary arm housing.410a to be fixed, is formed at an outer circumferential surface of the.decorative panel.430a. The fixing.pins.434a bend to an inside of the lower side of each extension rib 423 to fix the.decorative panel.430a to the.auxiliary arm housing.410a. In some implementations, a separate adhesive as well as the fixing.pin.434a may be used between the.decorative panel.430a and the.auxiliary arm housing.410a to fix the.decorative panel.430a to the.auxiliary arm housing.410a..In addition, a pivoting.protrusion.425a coupled to the first.auxiliary link.950a of the.linker.900 is formed at the lower part of the auxiliary arm.flow path part.411a. A.stoppage protrusion.427a is formed by bending an end of the pivoting.protrusion.425a to hold the first.auxiliary link.950a. The.stoppage protrusion.427a may extend to a center side of the.spray arm.200 for coupling of the first.auxiliary link.950a. Furthermore, the.stoppage protrusion.427a may be formed to be shorter than at least first pivoting.elongated holes.971a formed at the first.auxiliary link.950a. The.stoppage protrusion.427a may be formed to be held at the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a when the.linker.900 is mounted..In some implementations, each of the first.auxiliary nozzles.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415a may be formed to have a circular hole shape or a slot shape in order to enlarge the area where the wash water is sprayed. Furthermore, the sprayed directions of the first.auxiliary nozzles.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415a may be formed to generate driving force in which the.spray arm.200 is capable of rotating upon rotation of the first.auxiliary arm.400a..For example, driving force due to the wash water sprayed from the first.auxiliary nozzles.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415a may be increased or decreased by rotation of the first.auxiliary arm.400a. However, the direction of driving force due to the wash water sprayed from the first.auxiliary nozzles.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415a may be constantly formed..In some implementations, as illustrated in.FIGS. 13.and.14., a.coupling hole.416a, into which the.shaft.338 of the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a is inserted, is formed at an end of an inside of the auxiliary arm flow path 412a. In this example, the end of the inside of the auxiliary arm flow path 412a is defined as a supporting.part.416. For example, the.coupling hole.416a may be formed at the supporting.part.416. The.shaft.338 may be inserted into the.coupling hole.416. Furthermore, in the supporting.part.416, the.key groove.419a, into which the.insertion key.338a formed at the.shaft.338 is inserted, connected to the.coupling hole.416a may be further formed..In this example, the.key groove.417a formed at the.coupling hole.416a may be formed to be opposite to the.insertion key.338a in the state where the first auxiliary arm is normally mounted. For example, when the first.auxiliary arm.400a in the reverse state is inserted into the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a such that the.shaft.338 of the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a is inserted into the.coupling hole.416a while the.insertion key.338 of the.shaft.338 is inserted into the.key groove.417a of the.coupling hole.416a..Then, when the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a is completely inserted into the first.auxiliary arm.400a, the first.auxiliary arm.400a rotates such that the position of the.key groove.417a of the.coupling hole.416a is spaced apart from the position of the.insertion key.338 of the.shaft.338, thereby preventing the first auxiliary arm 440a from being separated from the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a..In some implementations, a.reflective plate.418a is formed at the outside of the.coupling hole.416a of the first.auxiliary arm.400a to prevent the wash water discharged from the.coupling hole.416a and the.key groove.417a from being scattered. In the case where the.coupling hole.416a and the.key groove.417a of the first.auxiliary arm.400a is formed at an end of the auxiliary arm flow path 415 where the wash water moves, when the wash water is scattered from the first.auxiliary nozzles.414a or the first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415a of the first.auxiliary arm.400a, the little amount of the wash water may be discharged through the.coupling hole.416a and the.key groove.417a. The wash water discharged through the.coupling hole.416a and the.key groove.417a may be inadvertently scattered to the inner wall of the.washing tub.10. Accordingly, the.reflective plate.418a may be provided to prevent the wash water discharged through the.coupling hole.416a and the.key groove.417a from scattering and may drop to the.sump cover.50..In addition, the foreign.substance discharge holes.419a are formed at the extending.pipe.331 of a front end (i.e. a part provided at the extending.pipe.331 of the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a) of the auxiliary arm.flow path part.411a to discharge the foreign substances introduced into the auxiliary arm flow path 412a of the auxiliary arm flow path part 411. The foreign.substance discharge holes.419a are formed between a pair of sealing ribs of a plurality of sealing.ribs.332a, 332b, and 332c formed at the extending.pipe.331 of the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a..Accordingly, when the wash water is introduced into the auxiliary arm flow path 412a of the first.auxiliary arm.400a, a part of the wash water may be introduced into the extending.pipe.331 through the flow.path forming protrusion.333a by pressure of the wash water. The introduced wash water may be discharged with the foreign substances introduced between the extending.pipe.331 and the first.auxiliary arm.400a..In this example, the first.auxiliary arm.400a performs reciprocating rotational motion about the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a according to rotation of the.spray arm.200. As the wash water is sprayed from the first.auxiliary nozzles.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415b, the driving force generated by the.nozzles.414a and 415a may be increased or decreased..In some implementations, a.first driving nozzle.422a (see.FIG. 12.) for generating driving force of the first.auxiliary arm.400a may be further formed at an end of the auxiliary arm.flow path part.411a. The.first driving nozzle.422a may be inclined in a direction opposite to a rotation direction of the first.auxiliary arm.400a. The.first driving nozzle.422a may generate greater driving force than driving force generated by the first auxiliary.inclined nozzle.415a. The.first driving nozzle.422a may allow driving force of the first.auxiliary arm.400a to be directed upwards. In addition, the.first driving nozzle.422a may be formed to wash an outer part of the.washing tub.10..In some implementations, an auxiliary arm.divergent flow path.413a (see.FIG. 14(c).) having a smaller area than that of the auxiliary arm flow path 412a may be further formed at the auxiliary arm flow path 412a to supply the wash water to the.first driving nozzle.422a. In the auxiliary arm.divergent flow path.413a, pressure of the wash water sprayed from the.first driving nozzle.422a may be increased by decrease of a cross-sectional area of the flow path where the wash water flows..In some implementations, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b may have physically similar structures. However, positions of the first.auxiliary nozzles.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415a are different. For example, the first and the second.auxiliary nozzles.414a and 414b and the first and the second auxiliary inclined.nozzles.415a and 415b which are formed at the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b, respectively, may be formed to have different sprayed areas upon rotation thereof. Accordingly, if the same first.auxiliary arms.400a (or the second.auxiliary arms.400b) are mounted at the first and the second.auxiliary arm connectors.330a and 330b, the same sprayed areas may be provided by the first.auxiliary arms.400a (or the second.auxiliary arms.400b), thereby decreasing washing efficiency..Thus, an auxiliary arm marker may be further formed to distinguish the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b. In this example, the auxiliary arm marker may be formed at the lower surface of the.auxiliary arm housing.410a and may be formed to have a certain figure or character shape..In some implementations, separate reinforcing.ribs.424a (see.FIG. 13.) may be formed to reinforce the extension rib 423 forming the.auxiliary arm housing.410a. Positions of the reinforcing.ribs.424a formed at the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are different such that the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400 and 400b may be distinguished from each other. For example, when the position of the reinforcing.rib.424a formed at the first.auxiliary arm.400a is L1, the position of the reinforcing.rib.424a formed at the second.auxiliary arm.400b is L2 such that the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400 and 400b may be distinguished..In some implementations, an upward inclination surface 428a (see.FIG. 14(a).), inclined upwards at a certain angle D3 in an outer direction, may be formed at the lower surface of the end of the first.auxiliary arm.400a. The upward inclination surface 428a may be formed to prevent the.washing tub.10 from being in contact with the.spray arm.200 upon rotation or stoppage of the.spray arm.200..Hereinafter, the fixed.gear.500 of the.spray arm assembly.100 will be described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing..FIGS. 15-17.illustrate an example fixed gear..FIG. 17.illustrates a cross-sectional view taken along a line D'-D\" in.FIG. 16...The fixed.gear.500 includes a.rim.510, through which the spray.arm holder coupler.356 formed at the main arm.lower housing.340 rotatably passes, and at which a plurality of.first gear teeth.512 is formed, a.fasteners.530 extending from both sides of the.rim.510 to be coupled to the.coupling bosses.51 of the.sump cover.50, and a shielding.rib.520 extending from one side of the.rim.510 downwards to shield the inside of the fixed.gear.500..In this example, the.rim.510 has a ring shape to be greater than the outer circumferential surface of the spray.arm holder coupler.356. A plurality of.first gear teeth.512 is formed along an upper outer circumferential surface. At least three.space maintaining protrusions.514 is protruded at an inner circumferential surface of the.rim.510 to maintain a space between the spray.arm holder coupler.356 and the fixed.gear.500 and to prevent friction..In some implementations, upper surfaces of the.first gear teeth.512 and an upper surface of the.rim.510, on which the.first gear teeth.512 are formed, may be formed to be inclined downwards at a certain angle D4 in an outside direction of the.rim.510. For example, when washing using the wash water, the wash water and the foreign substances may be introduced into upper parts of the.first gear teeth.512. For draining and discharge of the wash water and the foreign substances, the upper surfaces of the.first gear teeth.512 and the upper surface of the.rim.510 may be inclined downward in an outer direction of the.rim.510..Furthermore, a.support surface.516 being in contact with the.separation preventing part.620 of the.spray arm holder.600 is formed at the lower surface of the.rim.510. The.support surface.516 may be inclined upward to the center of the.rim.510..In some implementations, upon rotation of the.spray arm.200, the.spray arm holder.600 coupled to the.spray arm.200 rotates. In the state where the.spray arm holder.600 is inserted into the spray arm.holder seating part.53 of the.sump cover.50, the.spray arm holder.600 receives pressure of the wash water upwards and thus rotates in a floating manner. In this example, the.spray arm holder.600 may float in a horizontal direction by the.spray arm holder.600 and the space of the.spray arm holder.600..In this example, when the.spray arm holder.600 ascends due to pressure of the wash water according to rotation of the.spray arm.200, the.support surface.516 of the.rim.510 may prevent the.separation preventing part.620 of the.spray arm holder.600 from floating using the inclination of the.support surface.516..In addition, the.fasteners.530 extend at both sides of the.rim.510 in a lower direction of the.rim.510. The.coupling hole.532, into which the.coupling bosses.51 of the.sump cover.50 are inserted, is formed. The.coupling hoe.532 may be fixed by a separate coupling member (e. g. a screw, not shown)..In some implementations, the shielding.rib.520 is formed at a front side of the rim 510 (i.e. the.door.30 side) to shield the.spray arm holder.600 provided in the fixed.gear.500. For example, upon detachment of the.filter.70 and the.filter cover.60 which are provided at the front side of the shielding.rib.520, the shielding.rib.520 may prevent the foreign substances from being introduced into the inside of the fixed.gear.500 or may prevent a user's hand from being inserted therein..Hereinafter, the.spray arm holder.600 of the.spray arm assembly.100 will be described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing..FIGS. 18-21.illustrate an example spray arm holder..As illustrated in.FIGS. 18-21., the.spray arm holder.600 includes the.main arm inserter.610 inserted into the spray.arm holder coupler.356 of the.spray arm.200 while forming a space for mounting the.flow path converter.700, the.separation preventing part.620 formed at an outer circumferential surface of the.main arm inserter.610 to be fixed to the spray.arm holder coupler.356 while being held at the.support surface.516 of the fixed.gear.500, and the.sump inserter.630 protruding from the lower part of the.main arm inserter.610 while being rotatably inserted into the spray arm.holder seating part.53..In this example, an outer circumferential surface of the.main arm inserter.610 is formed to correspond to an inner circumferential surface of the spray.arm holder coupler.356. A.valve chamber.612 into which the.flow path converter.700 is inserted is formed. A plurality of.support protrusions.614 being in contact with lower.inclined protrusions.730a, 730b, 730c, and 730d of the.flow path converter.700 are form at the lower surface of the.valve chamber.612. A hollow hole where the wash water is introduced is formed at a central lower part of the.valve chamber.612..In this example, the number of the.support protrusions.614 may be increased and decreased according to the number of the flow paths formed at the.spray arm.200. Since the first and the second.main flow paths.301a and 301b and the first and the second.auxiliary flow paths.301c and 301d are formed, at least four.support protrusions.614 may be provided..Furthermore, each.support protrusion.614 may be formed in a rotated state at about 30 to 45 degrees with respect to the formation angle of the lower flow.path formation rib.354 forming the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b and the first and the second extension.flow path inlets.354c and 354d..The.separation preventing part.620 is enlarged to be greater than the.main arm inserter.610 at the lower part of the.main arm inserter.610. A main.arm seating part.622 being in contact with a lower end of the spray.arm holder coupler.356 is formed. A.gripping part.624 for mounting the.spray arm holder.600 to the spray.arm holder coupler.356 is formed at the outer circumferential surface of the main.arm seating part.622..In this example, a holding.protrusion.622a is formed at the inner circumferential surface of the main.arm seating part.622 to hold the spray arm.holder coupler protrusion.356a formed at the outer circumferential surface of the spray.arm holder coupler.356. The spray arm.holder coupler protrusion.356a and the holding.protrusion.622a are formed to be fixed or released according to rotation of the.spray arm holder.600..In addition, when the.separation preventing part.620 rotates at the upper surface of the.gripping part.624 while being in contact with the.support surface.516 of the fixed.gear.500, a plurality of.anti friction protrusions.626 may be formed to decrease friction of the.support surface.516. In some implementations, a plurality of.engagement grooves.624a may be further formed at the outer circumferential surface of the.gripping part.624, thereby easily rotating when the.spray arm holder.600 is mounted..In some implementations, a plurality of.wear prevention ribs.616 are formed at the lower surface of the.main arm inserter.610 to minimize contact with the.support boss.55 of the spray arm.holder seating part.53 when the.spray arm holder.600 is inserted into the spray arm.holder seating part.53..In some implementations, the.sump inserter.630 is formed to communicate with the central part of the.main arm inserter.610. The.sump inserter.630 is hollow such that the wash water supplied from the sump may be introduced therein. The.extension.636 is formed at the lower end of the.sump inserter.630 to be held at the.seating ribs.57 formed at the spray arm.holder seating part.53 of the.sump cover.50..In addition, a plurality of sealing.ribs.634 protruding toward the inner circumferential surface of the spray arm.holder seating part.53 may be formed at the lower side of the outer circumferential surface of the.sump inserter.630. A plurality of.space maintaining protrusions.632 may be formed at the upper side of the outer circumferential surface of the.sump inserter.630 to maintain a space between the inner circumferential surface of the spray arm.holder seating part.53 and the outer circumferential surface of the.sump inserter.630..Hereinafter, the.flow path converter.700 of the.spray arm assembly.100 will be described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing..FIGS. 22-23.illustrate an example flow path converter..FIG. 24.illustrates an example fixed gear, an example spray arm holder, and an example flow path converter..FIG. 24.illustrates a cross-sectional view taken along a line X'-X\" in.FIG. 2...As illustrated in.FIGS. 22-24., the.flow path converter.700 may include the disk-shaped.rotary plate.710 inserted into the.valve chamber.612 of the.spray arm holder.600, the first, second, third, and fourth upper.inclined protrusions.720a, 720b, 720c, and 720d formed at the upper.rotary plate.710 while being inserted into the lower flow.path formation rib.354 of the main arm.lower housing.340 to rotate the.rotary plate.710, and first, second, third, and fourth lower.inclined protrusions.730a, 730b, 730c, and 730d formed at the lower part of the.rotary plate.710 while being held at the.support protrusions.614 formed at the.valve chamber.612 of the.spray arm holder.600 to rotate the.rotary plate.710..The.rotary plate.710 is accommodated in the.valve chamber.612 of the.spray arm holder.600. The.rotary plate.710 may perform reciprocating motion upwards and downward in the.valve chamber.612 according to water pressure of the wash water passing through the.valve chamber.612..Accordingly, the.rotary plate.710 may be formed a disk shape to correspond to a cross-sectional shape of the.valve chamber.612. In this example, a plurality of.space maintaining protrusions.712 is formed at the outer circumferential surface of the.rotary plate.710 to maintain a space between the inner circumferential surface of the.valve chamber.612 and the outer circumferential surface of the.rotary plate.710 and to minimize friction..In some implementations, the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c may be formed at the first and third upper.inclined protrusions.720a and 720c for the wash water to pass through. When the upper.inclined protrusions.720a, 720b, 720c, and 720d are inserted into the lower.flow path housing.354 of the main arm.lower housing.340, the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c may communicate with the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a, 354b or the first and the.second extension inlets.354c, and 354d of the main arm.lower housing.340..In this example, the first, second, third, and fourth upper inclined protrusions, 720a, 720b, 720c, and 720d may be provided at positions corresponding to the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a, 354b and the first and the.second extension inlets.354c, and 354d of the main arm.lower housing.340..Furthermore, the first, second, third, and fourth upper inclined protrusions, 720a, 720b, 720c, and 720d may be spaced apart from the center of the.rotary plate.710 and the outer circumferential surface of the.rotary plate.710 at a certain interval. In this example, the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c may be formed at outsides of the first and third upper.inclined protrusions.720a and 720c, which face with the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c, of the first, second, third, and fourth upper inclined protrusions, 720a, 720b, 720c, and 720d..In some implementations, the first and the second rotation inclined.surfaces.721a and 721c may be further formed between the first and third upper.inclined protrusions.720a and 720c and the.rotary plate.710. When the.flow path converter.700 ascends or descends, the first and the second rotation inclined.surfaces.721a and 721c may form rotation resistance such that the.flow path converter.700 may be rotated by the wash water passing through the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c..Thus, upon supply of the wash water, the.flow path converter.700 may be rotated by the wash water passing through the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c in one direction. Upon stoppage of the supply of the wash water, when the.flow path converter.700 descends due to load thereon, the.flow path converter.700 may be rotated by the wash water passing through the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c in one direction..In some implementations, the first and the second.anti-inflow protrusions.726b and 726d spaced apart from the second and fourth upper.inclined protrusions.720b and 720d at a certain distance while closing the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b (or the first and the.second extension inlets.354c and 354d) may be formed at the insides of the second and fourth upper.inclined protrusions.720b and 720d..In this example, when the first and the second.anti-inflow protrusions.726b and 726d are opened by the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b (or the first and the.second extension inlets.354c and 354d), the first and the second.anti-inflow protrusions.726b and 726d may close the inlets inserted into the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b (or the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b) such that they are not opened..Furthermore, each of the first, second, third, and fourth upper inclined protrusions, 720a, 720b, 720c, and 720d are formed at the first upper.inclined surface.723a and the second upper.inclined surface.725a. Each.upper corner.727a is formed between the first and the second upper.inclined surfaces.723a and 725a..In this example, the first upper.inclined surface.723a is formed in a rotation direction of the.flow path converter.700 and the second upper inclined surface 275a is formed in a rotation direction opposite to the rotation direction. The first and the second upper.inclined surfaces.723a and 725a are formed to have different angles. The first upper.inclined surface.723a may be formed to have a greater angle of inclination than that of the second upper.inclined surface.725a..In some implementations, the first, second, third, and fourth lower.inclined protrusions.730a, 730b, 730c, and 730d are held at the.support protrusions.614 provided at the.valve chamber.612 to rotate the.rotary plate.710. The first, second, third, and fourth lower.inclined protrusions.730a, 730b, 730c, and 730d may be provided to be spaced apart from one another at 90 degrees, with respect to the center of the.rotary plate.710..In this example, in the first, second, third, and fourth lower.inclined protrusions.730a, 730b, 730c, and 730d, each.lower corner.737a is formed between first and the second lower.inclined surfaces.733a and 735a..In this example, the first lower.inclined surface.733a is formed in a rotation direction of the.flow path converter.700, and the second lower.inclined surface.735a is formed in a direction opposite to the rotation direction. The first and the second lower.inclined surfaces.733a and 735a are formed to have different angles. The first lower.inclined surface.733a may be formed to have a smaller angle of inclination than that of the second lower.inclined surface.735a..Hereinafter, a process of opening or closing the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b or the first and the.second extension inlets.354c and 354d by the.flow path converter.700 will be described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing..FIGS. 25.and.26.illustrate an example operation of a flow path converter..As illustrated in.FIGS. 25.and.26., when the wash water is supplied through the.inlet.638 formed at the.sump inserter.630 of the.spray arm holder.600, the.flow path converter.700 provided at the.valve chamber.612 ascends by water pressure of the supplied wash water..As the.flow path converter.700 ascends, the first, second, third, and fourth upper inclined protrusions, 720a, 720b, 720c, and 720d are inserted into the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b and the first and the.second extension inlets.354c and 354d of the lower flow.path formation rib.354 formed at the main arm.lower housing.340, respectively..In this example, the wash water introduced into the.inlets.638 may be introduced into the first.main arm inlet.354a through the.first opening hole.722a. The wash water passing through the.second opening hole.722c may be introduced into the second.main arm inlet.345b..In some implementations, the.first extension inlet.354c and the.second extension inlet.354d are closed by the.rotary plate.710. Accordingly, introduction of the wash water through the first and the.second extension inlets.354c and 354d is blocked..In some implementations, when supply of the wash water stops, pressure of the wash water for transferring the.flow path converter.700 upwards is removed, such that the.flow path converter.700 descends due to weight thereof. In this example, when the wash water passes through the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c in the descending.flow path converter.700, the.flow path converter.700 is rotated at a certain angle in one direction by the first and the second rotation inclined.surfaces.721a and 721c formed at the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c..Accordingly, the first, second, third, and fourth lower.inclined protrusions.730a, 730b, 730c, and 730d provided at the.flow path converter.700 slip on the.support protrusions.614 provided at the.spray arm holder.600 to be rotated at a certain angle more in one direction, thereby being held at the.support protrusions.614..In this example, when the.flow path converter.700 descends, the first, second, third, and fourth lower.inclined protrusions.730a, 730b, 730c, and 730d are held at the.support protrusion.614 while the.flow path converter.700 rotates at a certain angle in one direction..In this example, the.flow path converter.700 may rotate at about 90 degrees. The reason for this is that, the first and the second lower.inclined surfaces.733a and 735a provided at the first, second, third, and fourth lower.inclined protrusions.730a, 730b, 730c, and 730d occupy an angle of 90 degrees on a circumferential surface of the.rotary plate.710..Although not illustrated, after the.flow path converter.700 descends, the wash water is introduced through the.inlets.638 formed at the.sump inserter.630 again such that the.flow path converter.700 ascends. As the.flow path converter.700 ascends, the first, second, third, and fourth upper inclined protrusions, 720a, 720b, 720c, and 720d are respectively inserted into the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b and the first and the.second extension inlets.354c and 354d of the lower flow.path formation rib.354 formed at the main arm.lower housing.340..In this example, when the wash water is supplied, the.flow path converter.700 ascends due to pressure of the wash water and the wash water passes through the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c in the ascending.flow path converter.700. In this example, the wash water passing through the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c pressurizes the first and the second rotation inclined.surfaces.721a and 721c formed at the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c. The.flow path converter.700 is rotated at a certain angle in one direction by pressure applied to the first and the second rotation inclined.surfaces.721a and 721c by pressure of the wash water..In this example, the first, second, third, and fourth upper inclined protrusions, 720a, 720b, 720c, and 720d are inserted into the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b and the first and the.second extension inlets.354c and 354d of the lower flow.path formation rib.354 while the.flow path converter.700 is rotated at a certain angle more in one direction..In this example, the.flow path converter.700 may rotate at about 90 degrees. The reason for this is that, the first and the second upper.inclined surfaces.723a and 725a provided at first, second, third, and fourth upper inclined protrusions, 720a, 720b, 720c, and 720d occupy an angle of 90 degrees on a circumferential surface of the.rotary plate.710..In this example, the first and the second opening holes 722a and 722c communicate with the first and the.second extension inlets.354c and 354d instead of the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b. Accordingly, the wash water introduced into the.inlet.638 may be introduced into the.first extension inlet.354c through the.first opening hole.722a. The wash water passing through the.second opening hole.722c may be introduced into the.second extension inlet.354d..In some implementations, the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b are closed by the.rotary plate.710. Accordingly, introduction of the wash water through the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b is blocked..The water supply pump provided at the sump may intermittently supply the wash water. In detail, after the wash water is supplied to the.spray arm holder.600 for a certain time, the supply of the wash water may be suspended for a certain time..For example, the sump performs the supply and stoppage of the wash water. Thus, as the.flow path converter.700 ascends and descends repeatedly to rotate, the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b and the first and the.second extension inlets.354c and 354d may be alternately opened and closed..Hereinafter, the.eccentric gear.800 of the.spray arm assembly.100 will be described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing..FIGS. 27-29.illustrate an example eccentric gear..As illustrated in.FIGS. 27 to 29., the.eccentric gear.800 may include a.rim.810, at which a plurality of.second gear teeth.812 is formed, provided at the outer circumferential surface of the.eccentric gear.800, rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 in which a.gear rotation shaft.347b is accommodated, and an.eccentric protrusion.830 inserted into the.linker.900 to move the.linker.900 with reciprocating motion..In this example, the.rim.810 is formed to be ring-shaped. A plurality of.second gear teeth.812 is formed along the outer circumferential surface. An.anti-friction rib.816 is formed to be protrude at the lower surface of the.rim.810 to minimize friction between the.rim.810 and the.eccentric gear container.940 of the.linker.900 supporting the.eccentric gear.800..In some implementations,.inclined surfaces.814 which are inclined downwards at a certain angle D5 in an outer direction of the.rim.810 are formed at upper surfaces of the.second gear teeth.812. For example, when washing using the wash water, the wash water and the foreign substances may be introduced into upper parts of the.second gear teeth.812. For draining and discharge of the wash water and the foreign substances, the upper surfaces of the second gear teeth may be inclined downward at a certain angle D5 in an outer direction of the.rim.810..In addition, the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 are protruded at the inner circumferential surface of the.rim.810 forming the.eccentric gear.800 in order to support the outer circumferential surface of the.gear rotation shaft.347b formed at the second lower.main arm.341b of the main arm.lower housing.340. The rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 are in line contact with the.gear rotation shaft.347b such that friction between the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 and the.gear rotation shaft.347b may be relatively decreased..Furthermore, the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 are protruded at the inner circumferential surface of the.rim.810 forming the.eccentric gear.800. For example, a plurality of spaces is formed between the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820. The spaces between the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 are provided as spaces where the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 are capable of being deformed elastically. When external force is applied to the.rim.810 of the.eccentric gear.800, the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 are deformed at adjacent spaces to thus secure spaces for deformation of the.rim.810..In some implementations,.protrusions.822 for securing the supported state of the.gear rotation shaft.347b are formed at an end of the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820. In the case where the.gear rotation shaft.347b is supported by the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820, when the.eccentric gear.800 is rotated, the.eccentric gear.800 is movable due to the spaces between the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820. Thus, in order to secure the supported state of the.gear rotation shaft.347b, each.protrusion.822 may be extended to have a certain height..In addition, the.protrusions.822 functions to secure a mounting position of the.eccentric gear.800. The.eccentric gear.800 is mounted at the lower part of the second lower.main arm.341b. Separation of the.eccentric gear.800 is prevented by the.linker.900..In some implementations, the.linker.900 is provided at the lower part of the second lower.main arm.341b. The.eccentric gear.800 may be provided downward at a distance corresponding to at least the thickness of the.linker.900, or a thickness of the.eccentric gear.800 may be increased. As a result, as each.protrusion.822 is formed to have a greater height L3 than the thickness of the.linker.900, the mounting position of the.eccentric gear.800 may be secured without increase of the thickness of the.eccentric gear.800..In addition, a.rotation shaft ring.824 being in line contact with the.gear rotation shaft.347b along the circumferential surface thereof may be further formed at the ends of the.protrusions.822. The.protrusions.822 are formed at the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 such that the support state of the.gear rotation shaft.347b may be secured. However, since the.protrusions.822 are extended from the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820, the.eccentric gear.800 may be movable due to the spaces between the.protrusions.822 and rotation.shaft support protrusions.820. Accordingly, the.rotation shaft ring.824 may be further formed to secure the support state of the.gear rotation shaft.347b..In some implementations, the.eccentric protrusion.830 is be protruded from the lower part of the.eccentric gear.800 to be spaced apart from the rotation shaft of the.eccentric gear.800 by a certain interval L4. Furthermore, the.eccentric protrusion.830 is inserted into the.eccentric gear container.940 of the.linker.900, in which the.eccentric gear.800 is accommodated. Thus, the.eccentric protrusion.830 may be formed to have a height L5 equal to or greater than the thickness of the.eccentric gear container.940..When the.eccentric gear.800 is geared to the fixed.gear.500 to rotate and revolve along the outer circumferential surface of the fixed.gear.500, the.eccentric protrusion.830 converts rotational force of the.eccentric gear.800 into linear reciprocating motion to be transferred to the.linker.900..In this example, the space L4 between the.eccentric protrusion.830 and the rotation shaft relates to a reciprocating distance and the rotation angles of the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b, which rotate according to the reciprocating motion of the.linker.900. For example, as the space between the.eccentric protrusion.830 and the rotation shaft is increased, the reciprocating distance of the.linker.900 may be increased. As the reciprocating distance of the.linker.900 is increased, the rotation angles of the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b may be increased..In this example, the.eccentric protrusion.830 may protrude at the.support protrusions.820 of the.eccentric gear.800 in an opposite direction to the.protrusions.822. Furthermore, in the case where the eccentric position of the.eccentric protrusion.830 overlaps an insertion area of the.gear rotation shaft.347b supported by the.support protrusions.820,.rotation shaft grooves.832 may be further formed in the eccentric protrusion 830 (i.e. the area into which the.gear rotation shaft.347b is inserted) for insertion of the gear rotation shaft 347..308In this example, in the case of the.rotation shaft grooves.832, in order to prevent friction between the outer circumferential surface of the.gear rotation shaft.347b and the.rotation shaft grooves.832 in the manner of the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820, rotation shaft.groove support protrusions.834 being in line contact with the outer circumferential surface of the.gear rotation shaft.347b to support the.gear rotation shaft.347b may be further formed at the.rotation shaft grooves.832..In some implementations, the.rim.810 forming the.eccentric gear.800, the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820, and the.eccentric protrusion.830 may be formed of synthetic resins using injection molding in an integrated manner. However, at least one of the.rims.810 forming the.eccentric gear.800, the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820, and the.eccentric protrusion.830 may be separately formed to be assembled to the others, if needed..Hereinafter, a coupling state of the fixed gear and the eccentric gear will be described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing..FIG. 30.illustrates an example eccentric gear..FIG. 30.illustrates a cross-sectional view taken along a line Y'-Y\" in.FIG. 2...FIG. 31.illustrates an example fixed gear and an example eccentric gear..As illustrated in.FIGS. 30 and 31., the.eccentric gear.800 is rotatably inserted into the.gear rotation shaft.347b formed at the second lower.main arm.341b of the main arm.lower housing.340. The.eccentric gear.800 is supported by the.eccentric gear container.940 of the.linker.900. The.second gear teeth.812 of the.eccentric gear.800 are geared to the.first gear teeth.512 of the fixed.gear.500..In some implementations, as described above, the number of.second gear teeth.812 formed at the.eccentric gear.800 and.first gear teeth.512 formed at the fixed.gear.500 may depend on rotation of the.spray arm.200 and rotational motion of the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b..In this example, when the number of.first gear teeth.512 formed at the fixed.gear.500 and the number of.second gear teeth.812 formed at the.eccentric gear.800 have a certain multiple relationship, rotation and cycles of the.spray arm.200 and the patterns of rotational motion of the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b may have a certain period according to the multiple relationship between the first and the.second gear teeth.512 and 812..For example, when there is particular multiple relationship between the numbers of first and the.second gear teeth.512 and 812, rotational motion of the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b may be constantly repeated according to rotational position of the.spray arm.200. Thus, spray pattern of the wash water sprayed from the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b may be fixed..In this case, since the spray pattern of the wash water sprayed from the.spray arm.200, the spray pattern of the wash water sprayed from the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b, and the sprayed areas are repeated with a certain cycle, the sprayed positions of wash water sprayed from the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are fixed..That is, when the sprayed positions of wash water sprayed from the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are fixed, the sprayed areas of wash water sprayed from the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are limited, thereby decreasing washing capacity due to the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b. When the sprayed positions of wash water sprayed from the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are fixed, the sprayed range of the wash water is fixed, thereby decreasing washing capacity of the.dishwasher.1..Thus, it is necessary to vary the spraying patterns of the wash water sprayed from the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b. To this end, the number of.first gear teeth.512 formed at the fixed.gear.500 and the number of.second gear teeth.812 formed at the.eccentric gear.800 may be formed to have a relative prime relationship therebetween. When the number of.first gear teeth.512 formed at the fixed.gear.500 and the number of.second gear teeth.812 formed at the.eccentric gear.800 are formed to have a relative prime relationship therebetween, the rotation pattern cycle of the fixed.gear.500 and the eccentric gear is longer than in the case of a multiple relationship between the numbers of first and the.second gear teeth.512 and 812. Thereby, the spray patterns of the wash water sprayed from the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b may be varied..In some implementations, each of the.second gear teeth.812 formed at the.eccentric gear.800 has a smaller diameter than that of each of the.first gear teeth.512 formed at the fixed.gear.500. Under-cut of the.second gear teeth.812 may be generated by the first and the.second gear teeth.512 and 812. Thus, under-.cut holes.812a may be further formed to prevent abrasion of the.second gear teeth.812 due to friction..Furthermore, when the fixed.gear.500, at which the.first gear teeth.512 are formed and the.eccentric gear.800, at which the.second gear teeth.812 are formed, are made of the same material, there is abrasion due to friction therebetween..In this case, there is a disadvantage with respect to the maintenance of the fixed.gear.500 and the.eccentric gear.800. Accordingly, the fixed.gear.500, at which the.first gear teeth.512 are formed and the.eccentric gear.800, at which the.second gear teeth.812 are formed, may be formed of different materials. The fixed.gear.500 may be formed of a harder material than the.eccentric gear.800..In some implementations, upon washing, if the foreign substances become stuck between the.first gear teeth.512 of the fixed.gear.500 and the.second gear teeth.812 of the.eccentric gear.800, it becomes impossible to rotate the.eccentric gear.800. In this case, when the fixed.gear.500 and the.eccentric gear.800 are engaged, rotation of the.spray arm.200 may be limited by the.eccentric gear.800..In this example, the.eccentric gear.800 is supported by a plurality of rotation.shaft support protrusions.820. The rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 may be elastically deformed into the spaces L5 formed between the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820. Accordingly, when the foreign substances are stuck between the.first gear teeth.512 of the fixed.gear.500 and the.second gear teeth.812 of the.eccentric gear.800, force due to the volume of the foreign substances is applied to the.rim.810 of the.eccentric gear.800 and the rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 in the.rim.810 are elastically deformed. Thereby, the.eccentric gear.800 may be rotated along the fixed.gear.500 regardless of whether the foreign substances are stuck between the.first gear teeth.512 and the.second gear teeth.812..Hereinafter, the.linker.900 of the.spray arm assembly.100 will be described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawing..FIGS. 32-34.illustrate an example linker..FIG. 34.illustrates a cross-sectional view taken along a line E'-E\" in.FIG. 2...As illustrated in.FIGS. 32-34., the.linker.900 includes the rim-shaped.body.910 having an elongated hole in which the spray.arm holder coupler.356 of the main arm.lower housing.340 is movably inserted, the first main link 920 extending from the rim-shaped.body.910 to the first.main arm.300a to be movably coupled thereto, the second.main link.920b extending from the rim-shaped.body.910 to the second.main arm.300b to be movably coupled thereto while being coupled to the.eccentric gear.800, the first.auxiliary link.950a extending to the.first extension.300c to be coupled to the first.auxiliary arm.400a, and the second.auxiliary link.950b extending to the.second extension.300d to be coupled to the second.auxiliary arm.400b..In this example, the.elongated hole.911 into which the spray.arm holder coupler.356 is inserted is formed in the rim-shaped.body.910. The.elongated hole.911 has a width corresponding to a diameter of the.spray arm holder.600 to move the.linker.900 with respect to the.spray arm holder.600, and a length corresponding to moving distance of the.linker.900. The.elongated hole.911 may be formed as an enlarged hole H1 having a greater size than that of the spray.arm holder coupler.356 and a different hole H2 having a center which is spaced apart from a center of the hole H1 at a moving distance, L6 i.e. the moving distance of the.linker.900..In some implementations, in the inner circumferential surface of the.elongated hole.911, the upward reinforcing.rib.913 is extended to the upper side of the rim-shaped.body.910 to reinforce the rim-shaped.body.910. In the outer circumferential surface of the.elongated hole.911, the downward reinforcing.rib.914 is extended to the lower side of the rim-shaped.body.910 to reinforce the rim-shaped.body.910..In this example, the upward reinforcing.rib.913 and the downward reinforcing.rib.914 reinforce the rim-shaped.body.910 while discharging the wash water and the foreign substances introduced into the upper part of the.linker.900..For example, introduction of the wash water and the foreign substances introduced into the upper part of the.linker.900 to the spray.arm holder coupler.356 is prevented by the upward reinforcing.rib.913 formed at the upper side of the rim-shaped.body.910 in the rim-shaped.body.910 and is guided downward of the.linker.900 according to the downward reinforcing.rib.914 formed at the lower side of the rim-shaped.body.910 at the outside of the rim-shaped.body.910..Furthermore, in the case of the downward reinforcing.rib.914, the first and the.second links.920a and 920b and the first and the second.auxiliary links.950a and 950b extend to form the downward reinforcing.rib.914. Accordingly, in order to form the first and the.second links.920a and 920b and the first and the second.auxiliary links.950a and 950b, the downward reinforcing.rib.914 may be formed to have a greater height than that of each of the first and the.second links.920a and 920b and the first and the second.auxiliary links.950a and 950b..In some implementations, cutting.parts.918 corresponding to the shape of the.spray arm.200 are formed in part of the outer circumferential surface of the rim-shaped.body.910 to prevent the.linker.900 from being exposed to the outside of the.spray arm.200. For example, the cutting.parts.918 may be formed between the first.main arm.300a and the.first extension.300c, and between the second.main arm.300b and the.second extension.300d..That is, there are obtuse angles D2 (see,.FIG. 5.) between the first.main arm.300a and the.first extension.300c, and between the second.main arm.300b and the.second extension.300d such that the.linker.900 provided below the.spray arm.200 may be easily exposed above the.spray arm.200. However, positions of the cutting.parts.918 are not limited and the cutting.parts.918 may be formed at different positions, if needed..The first.main link.920a may include a first extending.plate.921a extending to the first.main arm.300a in the downward reinforcing.rib.914 of the rim-shaped.body.910, a.first drain hole.927a formed in the first extending.plate.921a, and a first moving.elongated hole.929a formed at an end of the first extending.plate.921a to be movably coupled to the.first guide protrusion.345a of the first lower.main arm.341a..In this example, the first extending.plate.921a extends to have a smaller width than that of the first.main arm.300a. A first reinforcing.rib.923a extending to the lower side of the first extending.plate.921a is formed at the inner circumferential surface of the first extending.plate.921a (i.e. the outer circumferential surface of the.first drain hole.927a). A plurality of.wear prevention protrusions.925a is formed at the upper surface of the first extending.plate.921a to prevent friction between the first extending.plate.921a and the first lower.main arm.341a..In some implementations, when the wash water and the foreign substances are introduced into the upper part of the extending.plate.921a, the first reinforcing.rib.923a functions to guide the wash water and the foreign substances to the lower side of the first extending.plate.921a..In addition, the first moving.elongated hole.929a extends parallel to the reciprocating direction of the.linker.900. The first moving.elongated hole.929a may be formed to have a greater length than a moving distance of reciprocating motion of the.linker.900..The second.main link.920b may include a second extending plate 921b extending from the downward reinforcing.rib.614 to the second.main arm.300b, the.eccentric gear container.940 depressed to the lower side of the center of the second extending plate 921b to accommodate the.eccentric gear.800, and a second moving.elongated hole.939b formed at the end of the second extending plate 921b to be movably coupled to the.second guide protrusion.345b of the second lower.main arm.341b..In some implementations, the second extending plate 921b extends to have a smaller width than that of the second.main arm.300b. The eccentric gear container is formed in the second extending plate 921b..In this example, the second moving.elongated hole.939b extends parallel to the reciprocating direction of the.linker.900. The second moving.elongated hole.939b may be formed to have a greater length than a moving distance of reciprocating motion of the.linker.900..In some implementations, a rotation.gear insertion slot.917 is formed at the downward reinforcing.rib.914 at a position where the second extending plate 921b is formed. The rotation.gear insertion slot.917 allows the.eccentric gear.800 accommodated in the.eccentric gear container.940 to be exposed at the fixed.gear.500. The.eccentric gear container.940 may extend to the second.main arm.300b at the lower side of the downward reinforcing.rib.914..In addition, in order to accommodate the.eccentric gear.800 in the.eccentric gear container.940, the.eccentric gear container.940 may be formed to have a depth greater than the height of the.eccentric gear.800 except for the height of the.eccentric protrusion.830..Furthermore, a recessed.part.941 is formed at the upper surface of the.eccentric gear container.940 to prevent direct contact between the.eccentric gear.800 and the.eccentric gear container.940. At least three.wear prevention ribs.943 being in contact with the.anti-friction ribs.816 of the.eccentric gear.800 may be protruded at the recessed.part.941..In addition, an eccentric.protrusion insertion slot.945, into which the.eccentric protrusion.830 of the.eccentric gear.800 is inserted, and second drain holes 947 for discharging the wash water and the foreign substances introduced into the.eccentric gear container.940 are formed at the recessed.part.941 of the.eccentric gear container.940..In this example, each.second drain hole.947 extends in a perpendicular direction to a moving direction of the.linker.900. Accordingly, as the.eccentric gear.800 inserted into the.gear rotation shaft.347b rotates, the.eccentric protrusion.830 of the.eccentric gear.800 generates external force parallel to the first and the second.elongated holes.929a and 939b such that the.linker.900 may perform reciprocating motion..In this example, the eccentric.protrusion insertion slot.945 is formed to have a size equal to or greater than a radius of rotation of the.eccentric protrusion.830. A direction of the eccentric.protrusion insertion slot.945 may be differently set depending on moving distances of the.linker.900. That is, when the direction of the eccentric.protrusion insertion slot.945 is formed to be perpendicular to the moving direction of the.linker.900, the greatest reciprocating distance of the.linker.900 may be provided..In some implementations, the centers of the.elongated hole.911 of the rim-shaped.body.910, the first moving.elongated hole.929a of the first.main link.920a, the second moving.elongated hole.939b of the second.main link.940, and eccentric.protrusion insertion slot.945 of the.eccentric gear container.940 may be collinear. The reason for this is that, reciprocating motion of the.linker.900 may be effectively performed according to the reciprocating motion of the.linker.900 by the.eccentric gear.800.In addition, the first.auxiliary link.950a extends to the.first extension.300c and is coupled to the pivoting.protrusion.425a formed at the first.auxiliary arm.400a which is rotatably coupled to the.first extension.300c. In this example, the first.auxiliary link.950a may include the first.elastic buffer.960a extending from the downward reinforcing.rib.914 of the rim-shaped.body.910 to the.first extension.300c and the first.auxiliary arm coupler.970a formed at the end of the first.elastic buffer.960a to be coupled so as to the pivoting.protrusion.425a..Furthermore, the second.auxiliary link.950b extends to the.second extension.300d and is coupled to the pivoting.protrusion.425a formed at the second.auxiliary arm.400b which is rotatably coupled to the.second extension.300d. In this example, the second.auxiliary link.950b may include the second.elastic buffer.960b extending from the downward reinforcing.rib.914 of the rim-shaped.body.910 to the.second extension.300d and the second.auxiliary arm coupler.970b formed at the end of the second.elastic buffer.960b to be coupled to the pivoting.protrusion.425a..In some implementations, the rim-shaped.body.910, the first and the second.main links.920a and 920b, and the first and the second.auxiliary links.950a and 950b may be separately formed and then may be assembled. However, for convenience of manufacturing, the rim-shaped.body.910, the first and the second.main links.920a and 920b, and the first and the second.auxiliary links.950a and 950b may be formed by injection molding in an integrated manner..In this example, the first and the second.elastic buffer.960a and 960b and the first and the second.auxiliary arm couplers.970a and 970b may be formed to have identical shapes and may be formed to be symmetric with respect to the rim-shaped.body.910. Thus, the first and the second.elastic buffer.960a and 960b and the first and the second.auxiliary arm couplers.970a and 970b are not separately described. The first.elastic buffer.960a and the first auxiliary arm coupler 940a will be representatively described below..FIGS. 35-37.illustrate an example first elastic butter and an example first auxiliary arm connector..FIG. 36.illustrates a cross-sectional view taken along a line F'-F\" in.FIG. 35...FIG. 37.illustrates a cross-sectional view taken along a line G'-G\" in.FIG. 35...As illustrated, the first.auxiliary arm coupler.970a includes the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a, to which the pivoting.protrusion.425a formed at the lower part of the first.auxiliary arm.400 is inserted is formed, formed at the end of the first.auxiliary link.950a and a first.inclined surface.973a formed at an adjacent part of the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a of the lower surface of the first.auxiliary arm coupler.970a to secure a pivoting space of the pivoting.protrusion.425a when the first.auxiliary arm.400a pivots..In this example, in the upper surface of the first auxiliary arm, the first.elongated hole.971a corresponding to the shape of the lower part of the first.auxiliary arm.400a is recessed, and both side of the first.auxiliary arm coupler.970a is protruded (see.FIG. 36.). In some implementations, the wash water and the foreign substances introduced into the upper surface of the first.auxiliary arm coupler.970a move from both sides of the first.auxiliary arm coupler.970a due to the shape of the first.auxiliary arm coupler.970a to the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a, thereby being discharged through the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a..In some implementations, the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a may be formed to have a certain length into which the pivoting.protrusion.425a formed at the first.auxiliary arm.400a may be inserted. The length of the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a may be equal to or greater than that of each.stoppage protrusion.427a formed at the pivoting.protrusion.425a. Furthermore, the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a may have a width such that interference between the pivoting.protrusion.425a and the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a does not occur when the.linker.900 performs reciprocating motion for rotating the first.auxiliary arm.400a..Furthermore, when the pivoting.protrusion.425a of the first.auxiliary arm.400a is inserted into the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a formed at the first.auxiliary arm coupler.970a, the position of the first.auxiliary arm coupler.970a may be a position at which the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a is not in direct contact with the pivoting.protrusion.425a or a position forming minimum contact between the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a and the pivoting.protrusion.425a..That is, when the.linker.900 performs reciprocating motion for rotating the first.auxiliary arm.400a, the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a of the first.auxiliary arm coupler.970a presses the pivoting.protrusion.425a to rotate the first.auxiliary arm.400a. Thereby, abrasion of the pivoting.protrusion.425a or the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a may occur. Thus, contact between the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a and the pivoting.protrusion.425a is minimized to prevent abrasion of the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a and the pivoting.protrusion.425a..In some implementations, the first.elastic buffer.960a may include a pair of.first extension links.961a extending from the downward reinforcing.rib.914 of the rim-shaped.body.910 to the center of the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a, a pair of.second extension links.965a extending to outsides of a pair of.first extension links.961a to be spaced apart from each other at a certain interval at the outside of the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a, and an.elastic link.963a at outsides of a pair of.first extension links.961a and insides of a pair of.second extension links.965a to connect the end of each of.first extension links.961a to the end of a corresponding the.second extension links.965a..In this example, as a pair of.first extension links.961a extend from the downward reinforcing.rib.914, each.first extension link.961a may be formed as a bar having a decreased cross-sectional area. A pair of.first extension links.961a may be formed to be symmetric with respect to the center between the.first extension links.961a..The reason for this is that, as the.first extension link.961a has elastic force and the rim-shaped.body.910 performs reciprocating motion according to rotation of the.eccentric gear.800, kinetic force of the reciprocating motion is transferred to the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a and strength of the rim-shaped.body.910 is maintained. For example, a pair of.first extension links.961a is formed to be symmetric since the.first extension links.961a maintain strength along a motion direction according to reciprocating motion of the rim-shaped.body.910..In some implementations, a pair of.second extension links.965a extends from the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a to the rim-shaped.body.910 while being spaced apart from each other at a certain interval at the outsides of a pair of.first extension links.961a. In this example, as the.second extension links.965a extend from the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a to the rim-shaped.body.910, each.second extension link.965a may be formed in the shape of a bar having an increasing cross-sectional area. A pair of.second extension links.965a may be formed to be symmetric with respect to the center between the.second extension links.965a..362In some implementations, the.elastic link.963a connects the end of each.first extension link.961a to the end of each.second extension link.965a to provide elastic force parallel to and in a perpendicular to the reciprocating direction of the first.auxiliary arm connector.330a..That is, since the first and the.second extension links.961a and 965a extend parallel to each other, when kinetic force is applied to the first and the.second extension links.961a and 965a in a direction perpendicular to the extending direction of the first.second extension links.961a and 965a, elastic force may be generated. However, when kinetic force is applied to the first and the.second extension links.961a and 965a in a direction parallel to the extending direction, elastic force may not be generated..Accordingly, the.elastic link.963a may connect the ends of the first and the.second extension links.961a and 965a to each other such that they are inclined at a certain angle, so that elastic force may be generated in other directions, which are not generated in the first and the.second extension links.961a and 965a..The.elastic link.963a may include bending.parts.964a curvedly formed at one side connected to the.first extension link.961a and at the other side connected to the.second extension link.965a. The bending.parts.964a may increase directional range in which elastic force is generated at the.bending parts.964a..In some implementations, when points of contact between the.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a repeatedly receives elastic force, damage due to stress concentration may occur. Thus,.link reinforcing parts.967a may be further formed at the points of contact between the.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a to prevent damage due to stress concentration. In this example, each.link reinforcing part.967a being in contact with the end of each link in a longitudinal direction of the outer circumferential surface of the link may be formed to have a cylindrical shape..Furthermore, as illustrated in.FIG. 37., when the wash water and the foreign substances are introduced into the upper part of the first.elastic buffer.960a, a horizontal width of each of the.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a may be smaller than a vertical width thereof, thereby discharging the wash water and the foreign substances. For example, when the horizontal width of each of.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a is greater than the vertical width thereof, the wash water and the foreign substances remain at the upper part of the first.elastic buffer.960a..Furthermore, in the cross-sectional view of each of the.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a, when the horizontal width is less than the vertical width, the buffering effect of the first.elastic buffer.961a may be effective. For example, as illustrated, when the cross-sections of the.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a are formed, the.linker.900 may be formed to be perpendicular to a reciprocating direction such that elastic force may be effectively generated in a moving direction of the.linker.900..Furthermore, elastic force of the first.elastic buffer.960a may be varied depending on materials or shapes of the.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a. For example, the.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a may be formed of materials having different elasticities, thereby controlling elastic force of the first.elastic buffer.960a. In some implementations, thicknesses, lengths, widths of the.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a may be changed to control elastic force of the first.elastic buffer.960a. Furthermore, formation angles or shapes of the.elastic links.963a connecting the first extension links 961 to the.second extension links.965a may be changed to control elastic force of the first.elastic buffer.960a..In some implementations, elastic deformation range of the first.elastic buffer.960a may be obtained by spaces between the.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a. For example, when the spaces between.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a are increased, elastic deformation range of the first.elastic buffer.960a may be increased. When the spaces between.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a are decreased, elastic deformation range of the first.elastic buffer.960a may be decreased..In addition, since the first.elastic buffer.960a corresponds to the shape of the lower surface of the.first extension.300c at which the first.elastic buffer.960a is provided, the.first extension links.961a, the.second extension links.965a and the.elastic links.963a may be formed to have different heights and different vertical widths..In some implementations, elastic force of the first.elastic buffer.960a satisfies minimum elastic force, in which the.linker.900 performs reciprocating motion according to rotation of the.eccentric gear.800 and generated kinetic force of the.linker.900 is transferred to the first.auxiliary arm.400a to rotate the first.auxiliary arm.400a, and elastic force, in which kinetic force of the.linker.900 is absorbed not to be transferred to the first.auxiliary arm.400a when the first.auxiliary arm.400a is restricted..In some implementations, there is a possibility of rotation restraint of the first.auxiliary arm.400a due to some cause such as deposition of the foreign substances. In this case, the.linker.900 transferring power to the first.auxiliary arm.400a, the.eccentric gear.800, the.spray arm.200, and the fixed.gear.500 may be sequentially restricted by the rotation restraint of the first.auxiliary arm.400a..That is, upon the rotation restraint of the first.auxiliary arm.400a, reciprocating motion of the.linker.900 is restricted by the first.auxiliary arm.400a. Rotation of the.eccentric gear.800 for performing reciprocating motion of the.linker.900 is restricted by restraint of reciprocating motion of the.linker.900. Relative rotation of the.eccentric gear.800 and the fixed.gear.500 is restricted by restraint of rotation of the.eccentric gear.800 to thus restrict rotation of the.spray arm.200 coupled to the.eccentric gear.800..In this example, upon rotation restraint of the first.auxiliary arm.400a, the first.elastic buffer.960a of the first.auxiliary arm.950a absorbs force transferred from the.linker.900 as elastic force, thereby performing the reciprocating motion of the.linker.900. Thus, despite of restraint of the first.auxiliary arm.400a, the.linker.900 may perform the reciprocating motion for rotating the first.auxiliary arm.400a. Thereby, the.linker.900 transferring power to the first.auxiliary arm.400a, the.eccentric gear.800, the.spray arm.200, and the fixed.gear.500 may be operated..Hereinafter, the mounted state of the.linker.900 will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings..FIG. 38.illustrates an example linker..As illustrated in.FIG. 38.,.2 and 3., the.first extension.300c and the.second extension.300d of the.main arm.300 are coupled to the first.auxiliary arm.400a and the second.auxiliary arm.400b, respectively. The.eccentric gear.800 may be inserted into the.gear rotation shaft.347b formed at the second.main arm.300b of the.spray arm.200..In this example, the.linker.900 is movably coupled to the spray.arm holder coupler.356 of the.main arm.300 through the elongated hole of the rim-shaped.body.910 of the.linker.900. In addition, the first and the second.main links.920a and 920b of the.linker.900 are movably coupled to the first and the.second guide protrusions.345a and 345b. The first and the second.auxiliary links.950a and 950b are coupled to the pivoting protrusions of the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b..Firstly, the pivoting.protrusion.425a of the first.auxiliary arm.400a is movably inserted into the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a of the first.auxiliary link.950a. In this example, when the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a of the first.auxiliary link.950a is held to the pivoting.protrusion.425a, in order to insert the.stoppage protrusions.427a formed at the pivoting.protrusion.425a, the first.elastic buffer.960a formed at the first.auxiliary link.950a is elongated at a certain distance while bending due to elastic force, such that the.stoppage protrusions.427a are inserted into the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a. Then, the first.elastic buffer.960a is restored to be held at the pivoting.protrusion.425a of the first pivoting elongated.hole.971a after insertion of the.stoppage protrusions.427a..In addition, the pivoting.protrusion.425a of the second.auxiliary arm.400b is movably inserted into the second pivoting elongated.hole.971b of the second.auxiliary link.950b. In this example, when the second pivoting elongated.hole.971b of the second.auxiliary link.950b is held to the pivoting.protrusion.425a, in order to insert the.stoppage protrusions.427b formed at the pivoting.protrusion.425a, the second.elastic buffer.960b formed at the second.auxiliary link.950b is elongated at a certain distance while bending due to elastic force, such that the.stoppage protrusions.427b are inserted into the second pivoting elongated.hole.971b. Then, the second.elastic buffer.960b is restored to be held at the pivoting.protrusion.425b of the second pivoting elongated.hole.971b after insertion of the.stoppage protrusions.427b..In some implementations, the.first guide protrusion.345a of the first.main arm.300a is movably inserted into the first moving.elongated hole.929a of the first.main links.920a. The.first extension step.346a formed at the.first guide protrusion.345a is inserted into the first moving.elongated hole.929a in an interference-fit manner, such that the.first guide protrusion.345a is movably inserted and separation thereof is prevented by the.first extension step.346a..Furthermore, the.second guide protrusion.345b of the second.main arm.300b is movably inserted into the second moving.elongated hole.929b of the second.main links.920b. The.second extension step.346a formed at the.second guide protrusion.345b is inserted into the second moving.elongated hole.929b in an interference-fit manner, such that the.second guide protrusion.345b is movably inserted and separation thereof is prevented by the.second extension step.346b..In this example, the.eccentric gear.800 movably coupled to the.gear rotation shaft.347b of the lower part of the second.main arm.300b is supported by the.eccentric gear container.940 of the second.main link.920b. Furthermore, the.eccentric protrusion.830 of the.eccentric gear.800 is inserted into the eccentric.protrusion insertion slot.945 formed at the.eccentric gear container.940 of the second.main link.920b..Then, the fixed.gear.500 is additionally coupled to the spray.arm holder coupler.356. The fixed.gear.500 is mounted to surround the circumferential surface of the spray.arm holder coupler.356. For example, the spray.arm holder coupler.356 is inserted into the.rim.510 of the fixed.gear.500. In this example, the.first gear teeth.512 of the fixed.gear.500 are geared to the.second gear teeth.812 of the.eccentric gear.800..Sequentially, the.spray arm holder.600 is additionally coupled to the.spray arm.200. First, after the.spray arm holder.600 is inserted into the spray.arm holder coupler.356, when the spray.arm holder coupler.356 is rotated at a certain angle, the holding.protrusion.622a of the.spray arm holder.600 is held at the spray arm holder coupler protrusions 656a of the spray.arm holder coupler.356, such that the.spray arm holder.600 is fixed to the spray.arm holder coupler.356..Then, the.sump inserter.630 of the.spray arm holder.600 is inserted into the spray arm.holder seating part.53 and the.fasteners.530 of the fixed.gear.500 is coupled to the.coupling bosses.51 of the.sump cover.50, thereby finishing the process mounting the.spray arm.200..Hereinafter, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b according to reciprocating motion of the.linker.900 will be described, with reference to the accompanying drawing..FIG. 39.illustrates an example operation of a linker..FIG. 40.illustrates an example operation of an auxiliary arm..In this example, (a), (b), (c), and (d) of.FIG. 39.are bottom views illustrating the.spray arm assembly.100, in which the eccentric gears 800 are rotated at 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees, respectively..FIG. 40(a).is a cross-sectional view illustrating the first spray arm without rotation and.FIG. 40(b).is a cross-sectional view illustrating the rotated first spray arm..Referring to.FIGS. 39(a).and.40(a)., when the.eccentric gear.800 is not rotated i.e. is in the initial state, the.eccentric protrusion.830 is provided at one side in the eccentric.protrusion insertion slot.945. In this case, the first.auxiliary arm.200 is provided parallel to the.main arm.300. In this example, when the wash water is supplied to the.spray arm.200, rotation of the.spray arm.200 starts using the wash water sprayed from the first and the second.main arms.300 and 300b or the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b..As the.spray arm.200 rotates, the.eccentric gear.800 provided at the.spray arm.200 is geared to the fixed.gear.500 fixed to the.sump cover.50 to rotate and to revolve along the outer circumferential surface of the fixed.gear.500..Referring to.FIGS. 39(b).and.40(b)., when the.eccentric gear.800 rotates at 90 degrees in a counterclockwise direction by rotation of the.spray arm.200, the.eccentric protrusion.830 inserted into the eccentric.protrusion insertion slot.945 of the.linker.900 moves in one direction to transfer the.linker.900 in one direction A..As the.linker.900 moves in one direction A, the first and the.second links.920a and 920b are guided by the first and the.second guide protrusions.345a and 345b formed at the first and the second.main arms.300 and 300b so as to move. The first.auxiliary link.950 rotates the pivoting.protrusions.425a of the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b in one direction..Accordingly, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b rotate at a certain angle in a clockwise direction. In this example, the angle to which the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are capable of being rotated may be about 15 to 40 degrees..Referring to.FIG. 39(c)., when the.eccentric gear.800 further rotates at 90 degrees in a counterclockwise direction by further rotation of the.spray arm.200, the.eccentric protrusion.830 inserted into the eccentric.protrusion insertion slot.945 of the.linker.900 moves in the other direction to transfer.liner.900 in a direction B opposite to a direction A. Accordingly, the.linker.900 is returned to its original position as illustrated in.FIGS. 39(a).and.40(a).. In addition, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are rotated by the first and the.second extensions.300c and 300d in a counterclockwise direction to be returned to their original positions..Referring to.FIG. 39(d)., when the.eccentric gear.800 further rotates at 90 degrees in a counterclockwise direction by further rotation of the.spray arm.200, the.linker.900 is moved by the.eccentric protrusion.830 along the direction B..In this example, the first.auxiliary arm.400a rotates to a certain angle in a counterclockwise direction (i.e. a direction opposite to a direction of.FIG. 40(b).). In this example, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b may rotate to about 15 to 40 degrees..In some implementations, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b, and the.linker.900 may simultaneously rotate at the same angle. The.linker.900 may perform reciprocating motion at a distance between the center of rotation of the.eccentric gear.800 by rotation of the.eccentric gear.800 and the.eccentric protrusion.830..Hereinafter, a principle of rotating the.spray arm.200 according to spraying the wash water at the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b and the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400 and 400b will be described..FIGS. 41 and 42.illustrate an example operation of a spray arm..FIG. 43.illustrates an example operation of an auxiliary arm..As illustrated in.FIG. 41., the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b include a plurality of first and the.second nozzles.314a and 314b and a plurality of first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b. In detail, the first.main arm.300a may include a plurality of.first nozzles.314a and a plurality of first.inclined nozzles.315a. Furthermore, the second.main arm.300b may include a plurality of.second nozzles.314b and a plurality of second.inclined nozzles.315b. When the first and the second.main arm inlets.354a and 354b are opened by the.flow path converter.700, the wash water may be simultaneously sprayed from a plurality of first and the.second nozzles.314a and 314b and a plurality of first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b..In this example, the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b spray the wash water in a direction opposite to the rotation direction of the first and the second.main arms.300a and 300b. The wash water sprayed from the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b may be biased to have an acute angle with respect to a rotation plane..Accordingly, the.main arm.300 may be rotated by driving force generated by the wash water sprayed from the biased first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b. That is, when the wash water is sprayed from the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b, a certain torque value capable of rotating the.spray arm.200 may be generated..In some implementations, torque applied to the.spray arm.200 by the wash water sprayed from the first.inclined nozzles.315a of the first.main arm.300a and torque applied to the.spray arm.200 by the wash water sprayed from the second.inclined nozzles.315b of the second.main arm.300b are oriented in the same direction with respect to the center of rotation of the.spray arm.200..In some implementations, at least one of the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b may be biased to spray the wash water at a tangent relative to the rotation trace of the.spray arm.200. In this case, torque may be further increased by spraying the wash water..In addition, the first and the.second nozzles.314a and 314b may spray the wash water in a vertical direction or in the same direction as the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b. The first and the.second nozzles.314a and 314b and the first and the second.inclined nozzles.315a and 315b may be oriented at different angles to spray the wash water at various angles..As illustrated in.FIG. 42., the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b include a plurality of first and the second.auxiliary nozzles.414a and 414b and a plurality of first and the second auxiliary inclined.nozzles.415a and 415b. In detail, the first.auxiliary arm.400a may include a plurality of first.auxiliary nozzles.414a and a plurality of first auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415a. Furthermore, the second.auxiliary arm.400b may include a plurality of second.auxiliary nozzles.414b and a plurality of second auxiliary.inclined nozzles.415b. When the first and the second.auxiliary arm inlets.354c and 354d are opened by the.flow path converter.700, the wash water may be simultaneously sprayed from a plurality of first and the second.auxiliary nozzles.414a and 414b and a plurality of first and the second auxiliary inclined.nozzles.415a and 415b..In this example, the first and the second auxiliary inclined.nozzles.415a and 415b spray the wash water in a direction opposite to the rotation direction of the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b. The wash water sprayed from the first and the second auxiliary inclined.nozzles.415a and 415b may be oriented so as to form an acute angle with respect to a rotation plane..Accordingly, the.main arm.400 may be rotated by driving force generated by the wash water sprayed from the biased first and the second auxiliary inclined.nozzles.415a and 415b. That is, when the wash water is sprayed from the first and the second auxiliary inclined.nozzles.415a and 415b, a certain torque value capable of rotating the.spray arm.400 may be generated..In some implementations, since the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are rotated in the same direction, the amount of torque and directions of the sprayed wash water may be changed by the wash water sprayed from the first and the second.auxiliary nozzles.414a and 414b and the first and the second auxiliary inclined.nozzles.415a and 415b..Hereinafter, spraying direction of the wash water in the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b, the first and the second.auxiliary nozzles.414a and 414b, and the first and the second auxiliary inclined.nozzles.415a and 415b will be described. In this example, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b rotate in the same direction and torque is generated in the same direction. Thus, the first.auxiliary arm.400a will be described by way of example, and a detailed description of the second.auxiliary arm.400b will be omitted..In this example, the change of spraying direction when the first.auxiliary arm.400a rotates in a reciprocating manner will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawing..FIG. 43.illustrates an example operation of an auxiliary arm..In this example,.FIG. 43(a).shows that the first.auxiliary arm.400a does not rotate..FIG. 43(b).is a view showing the first.auxiliary arm.400a maximally rotates in a clockwise direction..FIG. 43(c).is a view showing the first.auxiliary arm.400a maximally rotates in a counterclockwise direction..Referring to.FIG. 43(a)., the wash water is simultaneously sprayed from the first.auxiliary nozzle.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzle.415a. The spraying direction A1 of the wash water by the first.auxiliary nozzle.414a and the spraying direction A2 of the wash water by the first auxiliary.inclined nozzle.415a may be oriented towards a left upper side..Furthermore, each of the spraying directions A1 and A2 of the wash water sprayed from the first.auxiliary nozzle.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzle.415a may always form an acute angle with respect to the rotation plane of the.spray arm.200. Accordingly, torque may be applied to the first.auxiliary arm.400a in a rotation direction of the.spray arm.200 by the wash water sprayed from the first.auxiliary nozzle.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzle.415a.Referring to.FIG. 43(b)., in the case where the first.auxiliary arm.400a maximally rotates in one direction, each of the spraying directions A1 and A2 of the wash water sprayed from the first.auxiliary nozzle.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzle.415a may be oriented in a direction opposite to the rotation direction of the.spray arm.200. Thus, when the first.auxiliary arm.400a rotates in a clockwise direction, torque may be applied to the first.auxiliary arm.400a in a rotation direction of the.spray arm.200..Referring to.FIG. 43(c)., in the case where the first.auxiliary arm.400a maximally rotates in the other direction, each of the spraying directions A1 and A2 of the wash water sprayed from the first.auxiliary nozzle.414a and the first auxiliary.inclined nozzle.415a may be oriented in a direction opposite to the rotation direction of the.spray arm.200. Thus, when the first.auxiliary arm.400a rotates in the other direction, torque may be applied to the first.auxiliary arm.400a in a rotation direction of the.spray arm.200..In the case of the spraying direction A1 of the wash water sprayed from the first.auxiliary nozzle.414a, when the first.auxiliary arm.40 maximally rotates in the other direction, the wash water may be sprayed in a vertical upper direction. This may be a problem since torque direction applied to the.spray arm.200 is changed..Thus, the rotation angle of the first.auxiliary arm.400a should be less than the spraying angle of the first.auxiliary nozzle.414a. The term \"spraying angle\" means an angle formed by the spraying direction A1 of the wash water of the first.auxiliary nozzle.414a, in the case where the first.auxiliary arm.400 does not rotate, and a vertical line passing through the first.auxiliary arm.400a..Furthermore, the rotating angle of the first.auxiliary arm.400a should be less than the spraying angle of the first auxiliary.inclined nozzle.415a. The term \"spraying angle\" means the angle formed by the spraying direction A2 of the wash water of the first auxiliary.inclined nozzle.415a, in the case where the first.auxiliary arm.400 does not rotate, and a vertical line passing through the first.auxiliary arm.400a..Thus, even if the first.auxiliary arm.400a maximally rotates in both directions, the spraying direction A1 of the first.auxiliary nozzle.414a and the spraying direction A2 of the first auxiliary.inclined nozzle.415a may be always oriented in a direction opposite to the rotation direction of the.spray arm.200 such that torque may be applied to the first.auxiliary arm.400a in the rotation direction of the.spray arm.200..In the.dishwasher.1, the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b are rotatably mounted to the.main arm.300 such that reciprocating rotation, as well as rotation of the.main arm.30, is performed. Thereby, the spraying angles may be varied. Accordingly, washing efficiency of the.dishwasher.1 may be improved..Furthermore, the.main arm.300 rotates by driving force generated by spraying the wash water while the first and the.second spray arms.200 rotate. Thereby, there is no need for any separate driving source..In addition, rotational force of the.spray arm.200 may be converted into reciprocating rotational force of the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b by interaction of the fixed.gear.500, the.eccentric gear.800, and the.linker.900. Accordingly, there is no need for any driving source for rotating the first and the second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b..The present invention is further characterized by the following items:.1.
