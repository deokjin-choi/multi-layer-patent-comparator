With rapid development of a communication device technology, a display effect of a display of a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone is gaining more attention. However, a volume of the mobile phone restricts expansion of a size of the display..To implement a relatively large area of a display on a relatively small mobile phone, the mobile phone may use a foldable structure. The foldable mobile phone generally includes two housings. The two housings are connected by using a hinge mechanism, so that the two housings can relatively rotate to relatively fold or unfold the two housings. To better support a flexible display, and ensure that the flexible display is not excessively stretched and extruded when being folded and when in a folded state, the hinge mechanism usually includes a base and two support plates. The two support plates form a display accommodating space. The two housings are respectively fastened to the base by using mounting brackets. The two support plates are hinged to the mounting brackets and can relatively rotate around the mounting brackets. In addition, the flexible display covers all of the two housings and the hinge mechanism. In a folding process, the two housings drive the support plates to rotate simultaneously, to enable the display to switch from an unfolded state to a folded state..However, in the foregoing foldable electronic device, the support plates likely shake and stability of moving tracks of the support plates cannot be ensured..SUMMARY.Embodiments of this application provide a hinge mechanism and a foldable electronic device. In an unfolding process or a folding process, support plates can be prevented from shaking, thereby ensuring stability of moving tracks..According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a hinge mechanism including a base, and two mounting brackets, two support plates, and two linkage components that are symmetrically disposed relative to the base, where each mounting bracket is rotatably connected to the support plate located on a same side, one end of each linkage component is rotatably connected to the base, and the other end of the linkage component is connected to the mounting bracket located on a same side, to enable the two mounting brackets to be relatively folded and unfolded, a first lap joint structure is disposed on one end that is of each linkage component and that is rotatably connected to the base, and the first lap joint structure extends in a direction from one end of the base to the mounting bracket located on a same side as the first lap joint structure, a second lap joint structure is disposed on one side that is of each support plate and that faces the base, and the second lap joint structure extends in a direction from the side of the support plate to the base, and the second lap joint structure has a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface, the first surface is close to a flexible display, and in a process in which the two mounting brackets are relatively folded or unfolded, the second surface of the second lap joint structure slides along a surface of the first lap joint structure..In the hinge mechanism provided in this embodiment of this application, each mounting bracket is rotatably connected to the support plate located on the same side, one end of each linkage component is rotatably connected to the base, and the other end of the linkage component is connected to the mounting bracket located on the same side, so that the two mounting brackets can be relatively folded and unfolded. The first lap joint structure is disposed on one end that is of each linkage component and that is rotatably connected to the base, and the first lap joint structure extends in the direction from one end of the base to the mounting bracket located on the same side as the first lap joint structure, and the second lap joint structure is disposed on one side that is of each support plate and that faces the base, and the second lap joint structure extends in the direction from the side of the support plate to the base. As such, in the process in which the two mounting brackets are relatively folded or unfolded, the second surface of the second lap joint structure slides along the surface of the first lap joint structure. In this way, in a process in which the hinge mechanism is unfolded, the support plate is raised, and the second lap joint structure and the first lap joint structure relatively slide and are gradually raised, until the hinge mechanism is opened. Therefore, the foregoing setting can precisely control a moving track of the support plate, to prevent the hinge mechanism from shaking in a motion process..In a possible implementation, a third lap joint structure is disposed on one side that is of the base and that faces each support plate. When the two mounting brackets are relatively unfolded into an open state, a surface that is of the second lap joint structure of each support plate and that faces a same direction as the second surface abuts against the third lap joint structure located on a same side..The second lap joint structure on each support plate abuts against the third lap joint structure on the base, so that extrusion force borne by the support plate in a vertical direction can be transmitted to the base. Therefore, a problem that the support plate is deformed due to the extrusion force can be alleviated, and the extrusion force can be increased to improve an anti-extrusion capability of the hinge mechanism in an open state..In a possible implementation, the surface that is of the first lap joint structure and that is in contact with the second lap joint structure is an arc surface, or the second surface that is of the second lap joint structure and that is in contact with the first lap joint structure is an arc surface, or both the surface that is of the first lap joint structure and that is in contact with the second lap joint structure and the second surface that is of the second lap joint structure and that is in contact with the first lap joint structure are arc surfaces..When the surface that is of the first lap joint structure and that is in contact with the second lap joint structure is disposed as an arc surface, or when the surface that is of the second lap joint structure and that is in contact with the first lap joint structure is disposed as an arc surface, the first lap joint structure on the linkage component and the second lap joint structure on the support plate can move more smoothly when contacting each other and relatively sliding. When both the surface that is of the first lap joint structure and that is in contact with the second lap joint structure and the surface that is of the second lap joint structure and that is in contact with the first lap joint structure are disposed as arc surfaces, the first lap joint structure on the linkage component and the second lap joint structure on the support plate can move more smoothly when contacting each other and relatively sliding..In a possible implementation, the arc surface has at least two segments of curved surfaces, and two adjacent segments of curved surfaces in the at least two segments of curved surfaces are disposed at an included angle. The arc surface is disposed to have at least two segments of curved surfaces, and two adjacent segments of curved surfaces in the at least two segments of curved surfaces are disposed at an included angle, so that the support plate can better adapt to a moving track of the second lap joint structure when relatively sliding along the first lap joint structure..In a possible implementation, in a process in which the two mounting brackets are relatively folded or unfolded from a first position to a second position, the second surface of the second lap joint structure slides along the surface of the first lap joint structure..The first position and the second position are any two positions of the two mounting brackets in the relative folding or unfolding process. In other words, the first lap joint structure and the second lap joint structure may be overlapped with each other throughout the process, or may be overlapped with each other in a portion of the process. When the first lap joint structure and the second lap joint structure are overlapped with each other in the portion of the process, path overlapping between any two positions can improve motion stability of the support plate to some extent..In a possible implementation, a chute is disposed on the support plate, and a protrusion portion is disposed on the linkage component. A first hinge pin is disposed on the protrusion portion, and the first hinge pin runs through the chute and relatively slides along an extension direction of the chute..The chute is disposed on the support plate, the protrusion portion is disposed on the linkage component, the first hinge pin is disposed on the protrusion portion, and the first hinge pin can run through the chute and relatively slide along the extension direction of the chute, so that a relative sliding connection between the linkage component and the support plate can be implemented..In a possible implementation, each linkage component includes: a rotary slider and an arc arm. One end of each rotary slider is rotatably connected to the base, and the other end of the rotary slider is slidably connected to the mounting bracket located on a same side. One end of each arc arm is rotatably connected to the base, and the other end of the arc arm is rotatably connected to the mounting bracket located on a same side. Each support plate is slidably connected to the rotary slider or the arc arm, and rotation axes of the rotary slider and the arc arm on the base are parallel to but do not coincide with each other..The first lap joint structure is disposed on one end that is of at least one rotary slider and that is rotatably connected to the base, or the first lap joint structure is disposed on one end that is of at least one arc arm and that is rotatably connected to the base; or the first lap joint structure is disposed on each of one end that is of at least one rotary slider and that is rotatably connected to the base and one end that is of at least one arc arm and that is rotatably connected to the base..One end of each rotary slider is rotatably connected to the base, and the other end of the rotary slider is slidably connected to the mounting bracket located on the same side; one end of each arc arm is rotatably connected to the base, and the other end of the arc arm is rotatably connected to the mounting bracket located on the same side, and each support plate is slidably connected to the rotary slider or the arc arm, so that the two mounting brackets can be relatively folded and unfolded. In addition, the first lap joint structure is disposed on one end that is of each rotary slider and that is rotatably connected to the base, or the first lap joint structure is disposed on one end that is of each arc arm and that is rotatably connected to the base, or the first lap joint structure is disposed on each of one end that is of each rotary slider and that is rotatably connected to the base and one end that is of each arc arm and that is rotatably connected to the base, and the second lap joint structure is disposed on one side that is of the support plate and that faces the base. As such, in the process in which the two mounting brackets are relatively folded or unfolded, the second surface of the second lap joint structure slides along the surface of the first lap joint structure. In this way, in the process in which the hinge mechanism is unfolded, the support plate is raised, and the second lap joint structure and the first lap joint structure relatively slide and are gradually raised, until the hinge mechanism is opened. Therefore, the foregoing setting can precisely control the moving track of the support plate, to prevent the hinge mechanism from shaking in the motion process..In a possible implementation, a groove is disposed on one of the mounting bracket and the rotary slider, an extension portion is disposed on the other one of the mounting bracket and the rotary slider, and the extension portion fits the groove to implement a sliding connection between the mounting bracket and the rotary slider..In this way, the extension portion on the rotary slider can slide in the groove on the mounting bracket, or the extension portion on the mounting bracket can slide in the groove on the rotary slider, so that a relative sliding connection between the mounting bracket and the rotary slider can be implemented..In a possible implementation, a second hinge pin is further disposed on one of the mounting bracket and the arc arm, and a through-hole is disposed on the other one of the mounting bracket and the arc arm for the second hinge pin to pass through. The second hinge pin passes through the through-hole, to implement a rotating connection between the mounting bracket and the rotary slider..The second hinge pin is disposed on one of the mounting bracket and the arc arm, the through-hole is disposed on the other one of the mounting bracket and the arc arm for the second hinge pin to pass through, and the second hinge pin can run through the through-hole and relatively rotate. In this way, a relative rotating connection between the arc arm and the mounting bracket can be implemented..In a possible implementation, the support plate further has a circular arc bulge, and one side that is of the mounting bracket and that faces the support plate has a circular arc groove that matches the circular arc bulge. The circular arc bulge rotates in the circular arc groove, to implement a rotating connection between the support plate and the mounting bracket..In this way, the circular arc bulge on the support plate can relatively rotate around the circular arc groove on the mounting bracket, and connection stability between the mounting bracket and the support plate can be ensured, to avoid relative shaking..According to a second aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a foldable electronic device. The foldable electronic device includes at least a first housing, a second housing, and the hinge mechanism described above, where the first housing and the second housing are respectively located on two sides of the hinge mechanism, and the first housing and the second housing are respectively fastened to the mounting brackets in the hinge mechanism, and further includes a flexible display, where the flexible display is disposed on surfaces of the hinge mechanism, the first housing, and the second housing..In the foldable electronic device provided in this embodiment of this application, the hinge mechanism is disposed in the foldable electronic device. In the hinge mechanism, each mounting bracket is rotatably connected to the support plate located on the same side, one end of each linkage component is rotatably connected to the base, and the other end of the linkage component is connected to the mounting bracket located on the same side, so that the two mounting brackets can be relatively folded and unfolded. The first lap joint structure is disposed on one end that is of each linkage component and that is rotatably connected to the base, and the first lap joint structure extends in the direction from one end of the base to the mounting bracket located on the same side as the first lap joint structure, and the second lap joint structure is disposed on one side that is of each support plate and that faces the base, and the second lap joint structure extends in the direction from the side of the support plate to the base. As such, in the process in which the two mounting brackets are relatively folded or unfolded, the second surface of the second lap joint structure slides along the surface of the first lap joint structure. In this way, in the process in which the hinge mechanism is unfolded, the support plate is raised, and the second lap joint structure and the first lap joint structure relatively slide and are gradually raised, until the hinge mechanism is opened. Therefore, the foregoing setting can precisely control the moving track of the support plate, to prevent the hinge mechanism from shaking in the motion process, thereby improving user experience..With reference to the accompanying drawings, these and other aspects, implementation forms and advantages of the example embodiments will become apparent from the embodiments described below.

The following describes in detail implementations of the embodiments of this application with reference to the accompanying drawings..Emergence of a foldable electronic device brings about a breakthrough in a display manner of an original display device. Efficiency of information interaction can be doubled by one time of simple folding. In the future, designs such as a multi-folding design and a scroll design may further completely change information interaction manners. A foldable electronic display can not only flexibly change and switch modes based on different usage scenarios, but also can provide a high display-to-body ratio and high definition. Therefore, the foldable electronic display gradually becomes a hot research topic..Foldable electronic devices such as a mobile phone and a computer have become essential in our daily lives, and have even become part of our lives. In the foldable electronic devices such as a foldable mobile phone, a flexible display is usually folded and unfolded by folding and unfolding a hinge mechanism. The hinge mechanism is an important mechanism configured to implement folding. The foldable mobile phone includes the hinge mechanism, two housings, and a flexible display. An inward-folded foldable mobile phone is used as an example. The flexible display covers inner sides of the two housings, and the two housings are connected by using the hinge mechanism. The hinge mechanism is configured to enable the two housings to relatively rotate, so that the two housings can be relatively folded or unfolded. In other words, the foldable electronic device can be folded or unfolded..To better support the flexible display and ensure that the flexible display is not excessively stretched and extruded in a folding process, when the hinge mechanism is designed, it is necessary to consider leaving a display accommodating space for the flexible display when the flexible display is folded inward, so as to prevent the flexible display from being damaged when being directly folded. In a design, the hinge mechanism may include a base, and two mounting brackets, two support plates, and two linkage components that are distributed on two sides of the base. The two mounting brackets are fastened to the housings on two sides. The two linkage components are rotatably connected to the base and are connected to the mounting brackets, to implement a function of driving the housings on the two sides to be relatively folded and unfolded. The two support plates may relatively rotate or slide with the mounting brackets and the linkage components that are located on same sides, and form the display accommodating space when in a folded state, so that the flexible display can be accommodated in the display accommodating space after being folded inward, thereby avoiding extrusion..Further, when the housings on the two sides rotate close to each other to be relatively folded, one end that is of one support plate and that is far away from the base and one end that is of the other support plate and that is far away from the base are close to each other. When reaching the folded state, the two support plates and the base together form the display accommodating space. In this case, the flexible display of the foldable mobile phone is accommodated in the display accommodating space in a triangle-like or droplet-like form..When the housings on the two sides rotate away from each other to be relatively unfolded, one end that is of one support plate and that is far away from the base and one end that is of the other support plate and that is far away from the base are far away from each other, and the other ends that are of the two support plates and that are close to the base are close to each other. When reaching an unfolded state, the two support plates and the base together form a flat support plane. In this case, the flexible display of the foldable mobile phone covers the flat support plane formed by the support plates and the base..In the foregoing design of the hinge mechanism, because there is a gap between parts, for example, there is a gap between the base and the support plate or there is a gap between the support plate and the housing, some problems such as shaking of the support plate and an uncertain moving track of the support plate may be caused. Consequently, when the two support plates in the hinge mechanism drive the two housings to be unfolded, shaking likely occurs, and stability of the moving track of the support plate cannot be ensured..Based on the foregoing technical problems, embodiments of this application provide a hinge mechanism and a foldable electronic device. The hinge mechanism includes a base, and two mounting brackets, two support plates, and two linkage components that are symmetrically disposed relative to the base. Each mounting bracket is rotatably connected to the support plate located on a same side, one end of each linkage component is rotatably connected to the base, and the other end of the linkage component is connected to the mounting bracket located on a same side, so that the two mounting brackets can be relatively folded and unfolded. Then, a first lap joint structure is disposed on one end that is of each linkage component and that is rotatably connected to the base, and the first lap joint structure extends in a direction from one end of the base to the mounting bracket located on a same side as the first lap joint structure; and a second lap joint structure is disposed on one side that is of each support plate and that faces the base, and the second lap joint structure extends in a direction from the side of the support plate to the base. As such, in a process in which the two mounting brackets are relatively folded or unfolded, a second surface (the second lap joint structure has a first surface and the second surface opposite to the first surface, where the first surface is close to a flexible display) of the second lap joint structure slides along a surface of the first lap joint structure. In this way, in a process in which the hinge mechanism is unfolded, the support plate is raised, and the second lap joint structure and the first lap joint structure relatively slide and are gradually raised, until the hinge mechanism is opened. Therefore, the foregoing setting can precisely control a moving track of the support plate, to prevent the hinge mechanism from shaking in a motion process..The foldable electronic device provided in the embodiments of this application may include but is not limited to a foldable fixed terminal or mobile terminal such as a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a notebook computer, an ultra-mobile personal computer (UMPC), a handheld computer, a touch television, a walkie-talkie, a netbook, a point-of-sale (POS) terminal, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wearable device, or a virtual reality device..The following describes in detail the hinge mechanism and the foldable electronic device provided in the embodiments of this application by using an example in which the foldable electronic device is a foldable phone..Referring to.FIG..1.and.FIG..2., the foldable phone may include at least a.first housing.200., a.second housing.300., and a.hinge mechanism.100., where the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.are respectively located on two sides of the.hinge mechanism.100., and the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.are separately fastened to the.hinge mechanism.100.. Further, the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.are respectively fastened to mounting.brackets.20.in the.hinge mechanism.100...It should be noted that, the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.may be respectively fastened to the mounting.brackets.20.in a welding, bonding, screw locking manner, or the like..When the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.rotate close to each other to overlap with each other, the foldable phone is in a folded state. Otherwise, when the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.rotate away from each other from a state in which the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.are overlapped with each other to a state in which the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.cannot rotate (for example, the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.are located on a same plane), the foldable phone is in an unfolded state. A process from the folded state to the unfolded state is an unfolding process, and a process from the unfolded state to the folded state is a folding process..In addition, it should be noted that, there may be one.first housing.200.and one.second housing.300., so that the foldable phone can be folded into two layers. Further, as shown in.FIG..1., the foldable phone may include only one.first housing.200., one.second housing.300., and a.hinge mechanism.100.configured to connect the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.. The.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.relatively rotate to overlap with each other, so that the foldable electronic device is in a two-layer form..Alternatively, there may be a plurality of.first housings.200.and a plurality of second housings.300.(which are not shown), and a.hinge mechanism.100.configured to connect a.first housing.200.and a.second housing.300.adjacent to each other exists between the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300., so that the foldable electronic device can be folded into a plurality of layers. For example, the foldable electronic device may include two.second housings.300., one.first housing.200., and two.hinge mechanisms.100.configured to connect the.first housing.200.and the.second housings.300.. The two.second housings.300.are located on two sides of the.first housing.200., and are respectively rotatably connected to the.first housing.200.by using the.hinge mechanisms.100.. One.second housing.300.and the.first housing.200.may relatively rotate to overlap with each other, and the other.second housing.300.may also rotate relative to the.first housing.200.to overlap with the.first housing.200., so that the foldable electronic device is in a three-layer folded form. When two of the.first housing.200.and the.second housings.300.rotate to a same plane, the foldable electronic device is in an unfolded state..Referring to.FIG..2., the foldable electronic device provided in this embodiment of this application may further include a.flexible display.400., where the.flexible display.400.may be disposed on surfaces of the.hinge mechanism.100., the.first housing.200., and the.second housing.300.. When the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.are folded, the.flexible display.400.is bent and attached between the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.. When the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.are unfolded, the.flexible display.400.is correspondingly unfolded. In actual application, the.flexible display.400.may be bonded to the surfaces of the.hinge mechanism.100., the.first housing.200., and the.second housing.300., to ensure that at least a part of the.flexible display.400.stably covers an inner side of the.hinge mechanism.100., thereby improving stability of the.flexible display.400.in the foldable electronic device..Certainly, in some embodiments, the foldable electronic device may alternatively be a notebook computer. The notebook computer may also include a.first housing.200.and a.second housing.300.. The.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.can rotate close to each other to overlap with each other, so that the notebook computer is in a folded state. Otherwise, the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.rotate away from each other from a state in which the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.are overlapped with each other to a state in which the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.cannot rotate, so that the notebook computer is in an unfolded state. When the notebook computer is in the unfolded state, a part of a.flexible display.400.on the.first housing.200.may be used to display an image and the like, and a part of the.flexible display.400.on the.second housing.300.may be used as a virtual keyboard..The following describes in detail the.hinge mechanism.100.used in the foldable electronic device in this embodiment of this application..Referring to.FIG..3., the.hinge mechanism.100.may include a.base.10., and two mounting.brackets.20., two.support plates.30., and two.linkage components.40.that are symmetrically disposed relative to the.base.10.. Each mounting.bracket.20.is rotatably connected to the.support plate.30.located on a same side, one end of each.linkage component.40.is rotatably connected to the.base.10., and the other end of the.linkage component.40.is connected to the mounting.bracket.20.located on a same side, so that the two mounting.brackets.20.can be relatively folded and unfolded, so as to fold and unfold the foldable electronic device using the.hinge mechanism.100...In this embodiment of this application, as shown in.FIG..4.,.FIG..7., and.FIG..9., a first lap.joint structure.401.is disposed on one end that is of each.linkage component.40.and that is rotatably connected to the.base.10., and the first lap.joint structure.401.extends in a direction from one end of the base.10.to the mounting.bracket.20.located on a same side as the first lap.joint structure.401., and a second lap.joint structure.301.is disposed on one side that is of each.support plate.30.and that faces the.base.10., and the second lap.joint structure.301.extends in a direction from the side of the.support plate.30.to the.base.10.. In a process in which the foldable electronic device is folded or unfolded (to be specific, in a process in which the two mounting.brackets.20.are relatively folded or unfolded), the second lap.joint structure.301.slides along a surface of the first lap.joint structure.401...Further, the second lap.joint structure.301.has a first surface.3011.(refer to.FIG..9.) and a second surface (which is not shown in the figure) opposite to the.first surface.3011., where the.first surface.3011.is close to the.flexible display.400.. Further, the.first surface.3011.is configured to support the.flexible display.400., and the.flexible display.400.may cover the.first surface.3011.. In the process in which the two mounting.brackets.20.are relatively folded or unfolded, the second surface of the second lap.joint structure.301.slides along the surface of the first lap.joint structure.401...It can be learned that the first lap.joint structure.401.is disposed on one end that is of each.linkage component.40.and that is rotatably connected to the.base.10., and the first lap.joint structure.401.extends in the direction from one end of the base.10.to the mounting.bracket.20.located on the same side as the first lap.joint structure.401., and the second lap.joint structure.301.is disposed on one side that is of each.support plate.30.and that faces the.base.10., and the second lap.joint structure.301.extends in the direction from the side of the.support plate.30.to the.base.10.. As such, in the process in which the foldable electronic device is folded or unfolded (to be specific, in the process in which the two mounting.brackets.20.are relatively folded or unfolded), the first lap.joint structure.401.and the second lap.joint structure.301.overlap with each other in upper and lower positions and surfaces of the first lap.joint structure.401.and the second lap.joint structure.301.are in contact with each other. In this case, the second lap.joint structure.301.can slide along the surface of the first lap.joint structure.401.. In a process in which the.hinge mechanism.100.is folded or unfolded, the surfaces of the first lap.joint structure.401.and the second lap.joint structure.301.are designed so that sliding tracks of the two.support plates.30.can be precisely controlled, to prevent the.support plates.30.from shaking in a motion process. In addition, in the conventional technology, to prevent the.support plates.30.from being stuck in an unfolding process, a spacer between the.support plate.30.and the.base.10.is usually set to be large enough. In this application, in the process in which the.hinge mechanism.100.is unfolded, the.support plate.30.is also driven by the first lap.joint structure.401.of the.linkage component.40., to be raised based on a preset track until the.support plate.30.is flush with a surface of the.base.10.. In this way, the.support plate.30.will not be stuck due to a spacer of another part or the like, thereby avoiding a case that the.support plate.30.cannot be raised to an open state..Surface setting of the first lap.joint structure.401.and the second lap.joint structure.301.has the following three possible implementations..In a possible implementation, the surface that is of the first lap.joint structure.401.and that is in contact with the second lap.joint structure.301.is an arc surface. The surface that is of the first lap.joint structure.401.and that is in contact with the second lap.joint structure.301.is disposed as an arc surface, so that the first lap.joint structure.401.on the.linkage component.40.and the second lap.joint structure.301.on the.support plate.30.can move more smoothly when contacting each other and relatively sliding..In another possible implementation, the surface that is of the second lap.joint structure.301.and that is in contact with the first lap.joint structure.401.is an arc surface. The surface that is of the second lap.joint structure.301.and that is in contact with the first lap.joint structure.401.is disposed as an arc surface, so that the first lap.joint structure.401.on the.linkage component.40.and the second lap.joint structure.301.on the.support plate.30.can move more smoothly when contacting each other and relatively sliding..In still another possible implementation, both the surface that is of the first lap.joint structure.401.and that is in contact with the second lap.joint structure.301.and the surface that is of the second lap.joint structure.301.and that is in contact with the first lap.joint structure.401.are arc surfaces. Both the surface that is of the first lap.joint structure.401.and that is in contact with the second lap.joint structure.301.and the surface that is of the second lap.joint structure.301.and that is in contact with the first lap.joint structure.401.are disposed as arc surfaces, so that the first lap.joint structure.401.on the.linkage component.40.and the second lap.joint structure.301.on the.support plate.30.can move more smoothly when contacting each other and relatively sliding..Further, in some embodiments, the arc surface may have at least two segments of curved surfaces, and two adjacent segments of curved surfaces in the at least two segments of curved surfaces may be disposed at an included angle. For example, as shown in.FIG..9., the surface that is of the first lap.joint structure.401.and that is in contact with the second lap.joint structure.301.is an arc surface formed by splicing at least four segments of curved surfaces. Two adjacent segments of curved surfaces are not parallel to each other. In other words, there is an included angle between two adjacent segments of curved surfaces. The arc surface is disposed to have at least two segments of curved surfaces, and two adjacent segments of curved surfaces in the at least two segments of curved surfaces are disposed at an included angle, so that the.support plate.30.can better adapt to a moving track of the second lap.joint structure.301.when relatively sliding along the first lap.joint structure.401...It should be noted that, in this embodiment of this application, a size of the included angle formed between two adjacent segments of curved surfaces is not limited, and may be flexibly set based on a requirement in an actual application scenario, for example, an actual moving track..In addition, the first lap.joint structure.401.and the second lap.joint structure.301.may be slidably overlapped with each other throughout an entire process, or may not be slidably overlapped with each other throughout an entire process but be slidably overlapped with each other in a portion of the process. If the first lap.joint structure.401.and the second lap.joint structure.301.are overlapped with each other in a portion of the process, relative slip on lapping path between any two positions can improve motion stability of the.support plate.30.to some extent. That is, in a process in which the two mounting.brackets.20.are relatively folded or unfolded from a first position to a second position, the second surface of the second lap.joint structure.301.slides along the surface of the first lap.joint structure.401.. The first position and the second position may be any two positions in the process in which the two mounting.brackets.20.are relatively folded or unfolded..It should be noted that, specific positions of the first position and the second position and a motion path of relative sliding overlapping may be set based on a requirement in an actual application scenario, and are not limited in this embodiment of this application, provided that rotation stability of the.hinge mechanism.100.can be improved in a sliding overlapping process..Referring to.FIG..4.to.FIG..8., each.linkage component.40.in this embodiment of this application may include a.rotary slider.402.and an.arc arm.403.. One end of each.rotary slider.402.is rotatably connected to the.base.10., and the other end of the.rotary slider.402.is slidably connected to the mounting.bracket.20.located on a same side. One end of each.arc arm.403.is rotatably connected to the.base.10., and the other end of the.arc arm.403.is rotatably connected to the mounting.bracket.20.located on a same side. In addition, each.support plate.30.is slidably connected to the.rotary slider.402.or the.arc arm.403...It should be noted that, rotation axes of the.rotary slider.402.and the.arc arm.403.on the.base.10.are parallel to but do not coincide with each other..In this embodiment of this application, disposing manners of the first lap.joint structure.401.on the.linkage component.40.include but are not limited to the following several possible implementations:.In a possible implementation, the first lap.joint structure.401.is disposed on one end that is of at least one.rotary slider.402.and that is rotatably connected to the.base.10.. In this way, the second surface of the second lap.joint structure.301.of the.support plate.30.slides along the surface of the first lap.joint structure.401.of the.rotary slider.402...In another possible implementation, the first lap.joint structure.401.is disposed on one end that is of at least one.arc arm.403.and that is rotatably connected to the.base.10.. In this way, the second surface of the second lap.joint structure.301.of the.support plate.30.slides along the surface of the first lap.joint structure.401.of the.arc arm.403...In still another possible implementation, the first lap.joint structure.401.is disposed on each of one end that is of at least one.rotary slider.402.and that is rotatably connected to the.base.10.and one end that is of at least one.arc arm.403.and that is rotatably connected to the.base.10.. In this way, at least two second lap.joint structures.301.may be disposed on the.support plate.30., and second surfaces of the at least two second lap.joint structures.301.may slide respectively along a surface of the first lap.joint structure.401.of the.rotary slider.402.and a surface of the first lap.joint structure.401.of the.arc arm.403...One end of each.rotary slider.402.is rotatably connected to the.base.10., and the other end of the.rotary slider.402.is slidably connected to the mounting.bracket.20.located on the same side; one end of each.arc arm.403.is rotatably connected to the.base.10., and the other end of the.arc arm.403.is rotatably connected to the mounting.bracket.20.located on the same side, and each.support plate.30.is slidably connected to the.rotary slider.402.or the.arc arm.403., so that the two mounting.brackets.20.can be relatively folded and unfolded. In addition, the first lap.joint structure.401.is disposed on the.rotary slider.402., or the first lap.joint structure.401.is disposed on the.arc arm.403., or the first lap.joint structure.401.is disposed on each of the.rotary slider.402.and the.arc arm.403., and the second lap.joint structure.301.is disposed on one side that is of the.support plate.30.and that faces the.base.10.. As such, in the process in which the foldable electronic device is folded, the second surface of the second lap.joint structure.301.slides along the surface of the first lap.joint structure.401.. In this way, the second lap.joint structure.301.and the first lap.joint structure.401.relatively slide, thereby supporting the.support plate.30.to slide and retract. In the process in which the.hinge mechanism.100.is unfolded, the.support plate.30.is raised, and the second lap.joint structure.301.and the first lap.joint structure.401.relatively slide and are gradually raised, until the.hinge mechanism.100.is opened. Therefore, the foregoing mechanism can precisely control a moving track of the.support plate.30., to prevent the.hinge mechanism.100.from shaking in a motion process..Further, in some embodiments, still referring to.FIG..9.,.FIG..10., and.FIG..13., a.chute.302.may be disposed on the.support plate.30., a protrusion portion.4021.(refer to.FIG..4.) may be disposed on one end that is of the.rotary slider.402.and that faces the mounting.bracket.20., a first hinge pin.4022.(refer to.FIG..11.) may be disposed on the.protrusion portion.4021., and the.first hinge pin.4022.may run through the.chute.302.and may relatively slide along an extension direction of the.chute.302...Alternatively, in some other embodiments, a.chute.302.may be disposed on the.support plate.30., a.protrusion portion.4021.may be disposed on one end that is of the.arc arm.403.and that faces the mounting.bracket.20., a.first hinge pin.4022.may be disposed on the.protrusion portion.4021., and the.first hinge pin.4022.may run through the.chute.302.and may relatively slide along an extension direction of the.chute.302...In this way, a relative sliding connection between the.rotary slider.402.or the.arc arm.403.and the.support plate.30.can be implemented, thereby ensuring that, in the process in which the foldable electronic device is folded, the first lap.joint structure.401.on the.rotary slider.402.or the.arc arm.403.can abut against the second surface of the second lap.joint structure.301.on the.support plate.30.and the second surface of the second lap.joint structure.301.can slide along the surface of the first lap.joint structure.401.. Therefore, the moving track of the.support plate.30.can be precisely controlled, to prevent the.hinge mechanism.100.from shaking in the motion process..It is easy to understand that, in the conventional technology, when the first lap.joint structure.401.and the second lap.joint structure.301.are not disposed, one side of the.support plate.30.is suspended, and there is an assembly gap between the.first hinge pin.4022.and the.chute.302.of the.support plate.30.. Consequently, the.support plate.30.cannot be constrained in three directions. For example, when the.support plate.30.is pressed in a vertical direction, the.support plate.30.moves at a specific angle. However, in the.hinge mechanism.100.provided in this embodiment of this application, when the.support plate.30.is pressed, the second lap.joint structure.301.on the.support plate.30.is in contact with the first lap.joint structure.401.on the.rotary slider.402.. When the.support plate.30.rotates, a track of the.support plate.30.can be precisely controlled, and the.support plate.30.does not collapse in a folding process..In an optional implementation, the.chute.302.may be an arc-shaped chute. When being disposed as an arc-shaped chute, the.chute.302.can fit a moving track existing when the second surface of the second lap.joint structure.301.on the.support plate.30.slides along the surface of the first lap.joint structure.401.on the.rotary slider.402.or the.arc arm.403., thereby more precisely controlling the moving track of the.support plate.30., to prevent the.hinge mechanism.100.from shaking in the motion process..It should be noted that, the second lap.joint structure.301.extends (a specific extension length is controlled by the moving track of the.support plate.30.and a moving track of the chute.302.) relative to a length direction of the.support plate.30.. The.rotary slider.402.or the.arc arm.403.is similar to the.support plate.30.in this aspect. At a position at which the.rotary slider.402.or the.arc arm.403.is overlapped with the second lap.joint structure.301., one or more first lap.joint structures.401.extend from the.rotary slider.402.or the.arc arm.403.to overlap with the second lap.joint structure.301., and all surfaces that are of the second lap.joint structures.301.and that abut against the first lap.joint structures.401.may be arc surfaces. An overlapping length matches a width of the second lap.joint structure.301., and a length of the second lap.joint structure.301.may be slightly greater than a length of the first lap.joint structure.401.. A track line on the surface of the first lap.joint structure.401.is determined by a moving track of the second lap.joint structure.301.. The track line may be in a multi-segment form, where all segments may be overlapped with the second lap.joint structure.301., or some segments may be overlapped with the second lap.joint structure.301.and some segments may be kept away from the second lap.joint structure.301.. This is not limited in this embodiment of this application, and may be further adjusted and optimized based on an actual requirement..In addition, a.groove.201.may be further disposed on one of the mounting.bracket.20.and the.rotary slider.402., and an.extension portion.4023.may be disposed on the other one of the mounting.bracket.20.and the.rotary slider.402.. As shown in.FIG..4., the.groove.201.is disposed on the mounting.bracket.20., and the.extension portion.4023.is disposed on the.rotary slider.402.. In this way, the.extension portion.4023.slides in the.groove.201., and the.extension portion.4023.can fit the.groove.201.to implement a relative sliding connection between the mounting.bracket.20.and the.rotary slider.402...In an optional implementation, a.second hinge pin.4031.may be further disposed on one of the mounting.bracket.20.and the.arc arm.403., and a through-.hole.202.may be further disposed on the other one of the mounting.bracket.20.and the.arc arm.403.for the.second hinge pin.4031.to pass through. The.second hinge pin.4031.passes through the through-.hole.202., so that a relative rotating connection between the.arc arm.403.and the mounting.bracket.20.can be implemented. As shown in.FIG..4., the.second hinge pin.4031.is disposed on the mounting.bracket.20., and the through-.hole.202.is disposed on the.arc arm.403.for the.second hinge pin.4031.to pass through. The.second hinge pin.4031.on the.arc arm.403.passes through the through-.hole.202.on the mounting.bracket.20., so that relative rotation may occur between the.arc arm.403.and the mounting.bracket.20.. Therefore, relative motion between the.rotary slider.402.and the mounting.bracket.20.can be prevented from being affected..In addition, referring to.FIG..12.,.FIG..14., and.FIG..15., the.support plate.30.may further have a.circular arc bulge.303., and one side that is of the mounting.bracket.20.and that faces the.support plate.30.has a circular arc groove (which is not shown in the figure) that matches the.circular arc bulge.303.. In this way, the.circular arc bulge.303.on the.support plate.30.can relatively rotate around the circular arc groove on the mounting.bracket.20., and connection stability between the.rotary slider.402.and the mounting.bracket.20.can be ensured to avoid relative shaking..Further, in this embodiment of this application, the.circular arc bulge.303.may be an axial center of an arc shown in.FIG..14.and.FIG..15.. In a process in which the.rotary slider.402.slides, the.support plate.30.is pulled by the.first hinge pin.4022.fastened onto the rotary slider.402.(the.first hinge pin.4022.slides in the.chute.302.of the support plate.30.), so that the.support plate.30.rotates around an axial center of an arc of the.support plate.30., thereby implementing rotation motion of the.support plate.30...In addition to the foregoing design of the lap joint structures, in this embodiment of this application, as shown in.FIG..16., a third lap.joint structure.101.may be further disposed on one side that is of the.base.10.and that faces each.support plate.30.. When the foldable electronic device is in an open state, the second surface of the second lap.joint structure.301.of each.support plate.30.abuts against the third lap.joint structure.101.located on a same side. The third lap.joint structure.101.disposed on the side of the base.10.may more stably support the.support plate.30.in the open state without causing shaking or collapse because of an excessively large gap between the.support plate.30.and the.base.10.. In addition, the second lap.joint structure.301.on the.support plate.30.is overlapped with the third lap.joint structure.101.on the.base.10., so that extrusion force borne by the.support plate.30.in a vertical direction can be transmitted to the.base.10.. Therefore, a problem that the.support plate.30.is deformed due to the extrusion force can be alleviated, thereby improving an anti-extrusion capability of the.hinge mechanism.100...In addition, when the.support plate.30.is in an unfolded state, the second lap.joint structure.301.is overlapped with the third lap.joint structure.101.of the base.10.by a width, so as to support the.flexible display.400.of the foldable electronic device in the vertical direction. In this way, the.flexible display.400.can bear extrusion force in the vertical direction, and a significant increase in an effective support area of the.flexible display.400.can effectively reduce problems such as a pressing failure of the display when in use..It may be understood that, when the.support plate.30.is in the unfolded state, a height of the third lap.joint structure.101.of the.base.10.is lower than a height of the second lap.joint structure.301.of the.support plate.30.. In other words, the second surface of the second lap.joint structure.301.of the.support plate.30.is overlapped with a surface of the third lap.joint structure.101.. In addition, an overlapping width between the third lap.joint structure.101.and the second lap.joint structure.301.matches the motion track of the second lap.joint structure.301.. In this embodiment of this application, the overlapping length between the second lap.joint structure.301.and the third lap.joint structure.101.is not limited, and may be flexibly set based on an application requirement in an actual scenario..Further, when the third lap.joint structure.101.is combined with the design of the first lap.joint structure.401.and design of the second lap.joint structure.301., and when the.support plates.30.are relatively folded, because of the design of the first lap.joint structure.401., the second lap.joint structure.301.smoothly slides towards a direction far away from the.base.10.without being stuck by the third lap.joint structure.101.. When the.support plates.30.are relatively unfolded, because of the design of the first lap.joint structure.401., the second lap.joint structure.301.smoothly slides towards a direction close to the.base.10.and is raised to be higher than a position of the third lap.joint structure.101.without being stuck by the third lap.joint structure.101...Therefore, because of the linkage design of the three lap joint structures (the first lap.joint structure.401., the second lap.joint structure.301., and the third lap joint structure.101.), the.support plates.30.can be more smoothly and stably folded and unfolded. Therefore, the.entire hinge mechanism.100.moves more stably and smoothly, thereby improving a use effect..In addition, in this embodiment of this application, when the.first housing.200.and the.second housing.300.are completely closed together, the entire phone has an equal thickness. The base.10.plays a role of connection, and an appearance at the.base.10.is a complete structure without a hole and a protrusion. In this way, when a hole area in a region of the.base.10.is relatively small, an area supporting the.flexible display.400.can be increased, thereby reducing a failure risk when the.flexible display.400.is pressed..In the descriptions of the embodiments of this application, it should be noted that, unless otherwise clearly stipulated and limited, the terms installation, linkage, and connection should be interpreted broadly, for example, may be a fixed connection, or may be an indirect connection by using an intermediate medium, and may be communication inside two elements or an interaction relationship between two elements.
