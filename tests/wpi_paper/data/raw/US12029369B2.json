  "description": "Description.BACKGROUND.Due in part to the environmental concerns associated with disposable or single use beverage containers, many consumers are increasingly opting to use reusable cups, reusable bottles and other types of reusable beverage containers. In addition, some retail establishments, such as coffee shops, donut shops, and restaurants, have been willing to fill customer-provided cups and other beverage containers, and some have even introduced reusable cup programs where customers are able to purchase a reusable cup at a low initial cost when purchasing a beverage and then present that same cup at a later date for a refill..While such programs have proven to be beneficial for both consumers and retail establishments, ensuring that the reusable cups are clean and sanitary prior to filling can be a challenge. Some municipalities, for example, have instituted ordinances that require a retail establishment to clean a work space after handling a customer-supplied reusable cup. Furthermore, pandemic-related concerns have led many retail establishments to discontinue the use of reusable cups due to the potential for a transmission of germs or contamination..Retail establishments that serve beverages often use commercial-style dishwashers to wash cups and other utensils. Such dishwashers, however, are often configured to handle a large number of utensils in each load, and even the fastest dishwashers can still have runtimes of several minutes or more. Such dishwashers are also relatively large and noisy, and as a result are often placed in a kitchen or other area that is outside of the range of customers. As a result, traditional commercial-style dishwashers have a number of characteristics that make them generally unsuitable for use in connection with cleaning customer-provided reusable beverage containers..Therefore, a significant need exists in the art for a system capable of washing reusable cups and other beverage containers in a fast and sanitary manner, and in particular, a system capable of being utilized in a retail establishment to clean customer-provided reusable beverage containers prior to filling, and to do so in a manner that is both fast and compatible with a fast-paced retail environment..SUMMARY.The herein-described embodiments address these and other problems associated with the art by providing various improvements related to a beverage container washing system that may be used for rapid washing and/or sanitizing of beverage containers, e.g., for use in a retail environment to wash and/or sanitize customer-provided beverage containers prior to filling the beverage containers with purchased beverages, among other applications. Among other features, the beverage container washing system may include a pop-up sprayer that includes multiple nozzles, one of which is oriented to spray wash fluid into an interior of a beverage container and another of which is oriented to spray wash fluid onto an outer lip of the beverage container..Therefore, consistent with one aspect of the invention, an apparatus for washing a beverage container may include a housing defining a wash chamber, a holder disposed within the wash chamber and configured to hold the beverage container during a washing operation, and a pop-up sprayer disposed in the wash chamber and including a plurality of nozzles, the pop-up sprayer configured to rotate about an axis of rotation and to move between retracted and extended positions along the axis of rotation, and the plurality of nozzles including an interior nozzle oriented to spray wash fluid into an interior of the beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder and a lip nozzle oriented to spray wash fluid onto an outer lip of the beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder..Also, in some embodiments, the pop-up sprayer includes a manifold including an inlet configured to receive a wash fluid, an axial conduit extending generally along the axis of rotation, and a transverse conduit extending generally transverse to the axis of rotation, and the axial and transverse conduits are in fluid communication with the inlet, the interior nozzle is in fluid communication with the inlet through the axial conduit and is axially offset from the inlet along the axis of rotation, and the lip nozzle is in fluid communication with the inlet through the transverse conduit and radially offset from the inlet relative to the axis of rotation..Moreover, in some embodiments, the lip nozzle is a first lip nozzle and the transverse conduit is a first transverse conduit, the manifold further includes a second transverse conduit extending generally transverse to the axis of rotation and angularly offset from the first transverse conduit, and the plurality of nozzles further includes a second lip nozzle oriented to spray wash fluid onto the outer lip of the beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder, the second lip nozzle in fluid communication with the inlet through the second transverse conduit and radially offset from the inlet relative to the axis of rotation.

A beverage container may be reusable to the extent that the beverage container may be reused multiple times, in contrast with a disposable or single use beverage container that is generally thrown away after use..A beverage container washing system consistent with some embodiments of the invention may be used to wash or clean a beverage container. In some embodiments, a beverage container washing system may also be considered to be a sanitizing system that is also capable of sanitizing a beverage container to inactivate, reduce or destroy microorganisms on the surface of the beverage container, e.g., bacteria and other pathogenic organisms. Sanitization may be achieved through the use of high temperatures, ultraviolet irradiation, disinfecting agents, or some combination of the same, such that a sanitizing operation may be considered to be a particular type of washing operation where some degree of sanitization occurs in addition to washing or cleaning. It will be appreciated, however, that some of the concepts disclosed herein may be utilized in connection with washing systems that, while capable of washing or cleaning a beverage container, are not considered to sanitize the beverage container to the extent required to consider the beverage container as being sanitized at the completion of a washing operation..It will also be appreciated that a beverage container washing system consistent with the invention may be, but is not necessarily, used in a retail environment (e.g., a bar, a coffee shop, a restaurant, etc.) to rapidly wash the beverage container of a customer prior to filling the beverage container with a beverage that has been purchased by a customer, e.g., in some instances, less than one minute, and in some instances, about 30 seconds or less. Further, a beverage container washing system consistent with the invention may be, but is not necessarily, used to rapidly wash a single, individual beverage container in a washing operation. In other embodiments, for example, some of the concepts disclosed herein may be utilized in non-retail environments, including within a consumer's home, an office environment, or any other environment for which it may be desired to wash beverage containers. Further, even within a retail environment, a washing system consistent with the invention may be used in non-customer facing applications, e.g., behind the counter, in the kitchen, etc. Further, some of the concepts disclosed herein may be adapted for use in connection with washing multiple beverage containers in a single washing operation, as well as washing operations that take one or more minutes to complete..In the example embodiment discussed hereinafter, hot water (e.g., about 150 degrees/65 degrees Celsius or higher in some embodiments, or about 165 degrees Fahrenheit/74 degrees Celsius or higher in some embodiments), high pressure (e.g., about 100 psi or greater), high speed air for drying, and ultraviolet irradiation are used to rapidly wash and sanitize an individual beverage container, e.g., in about 30 seconds, and do so in a manner that has a minimal countertop space presence. Furthermore, in order to minimize interaction between a customer and retail establishment employee, separate entrance and exit openings are used, such that the opening in which a customer inserts an unwashed beverage container into the system prior to performing a washing operation is different from the opening in which a retail establishment employee removes the washed beverage container at the completion of the washing operation. A washing system consistent with the invention may, in some instances, move the beverage container between multiple stations to perform different actions, and in some instances, operate on different beverage containers concurrently in different stations. In other instances, a washing system consistent with the invention may perform all of the actions associated with a washing operation while the beverage container is maintained in the same location. It will be appreciated, however, that in other embodiments, a washing system consistent with the invention may use the same opening for insertion and removal of a beverage container, and may operate on multiple beverage containers at the same time. Further, in some embodiments, lower temperatures and/or pressures may be used, and ultraviolet irradiation and/or drying may be omitted, or additional actions, such as the introduction of detergents, disinfecting agents, etc. may be used. Therefore, the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments disclosed herein..Now turning to the drawings, wherein like parts are denoted by like numbers throughout the several views,.FIG..1.illustrates a beverage container washing system or.apparatus.10.consistent with some embodiments of the invention, and suitable for installation, for example, in a.cabinet.12.that forms a.counter.14.in a retail establishment. In the illustrated embodiment,.washing system.10.may also be considered to be a sanitizing.system.10.due to the use of hot water and/or ultraviolet irradiation, so these terms may be used interchangeably. It will be appreciated, however, that the reference to a particular concept used in a sanitizing system or in connection with a sanitizing operation does not necessarily mean that the concept cannot also be used in washing system or in connection with washing operations that are not necessarily considered sufficient for full sanitization of a beverage container..Counter.14.includes a.countertop.16., and.washing system.10.includes a.countertop portion.18.that projects above.countertop.16.and an.undercounter portion.20.that is predominantly mounted within.cabinet.12.to minimize the amount of countertop space occupied by.countertop portion.18.. In other embodiments,.washing system.10.may be fully implemented in a countertop, standalone or undercounter configuration, so the invention is not limited to the particular combination of countertop and undercounter portions as illustrated herein. In some embodiments, the countertop portion may be fixed to a countertop, but the undercounter portion may be separated, or may be mounted on a cart to simplify installation and service..With additional reference to.FIG..2., which shows an opposite side of.countertop portion.18.of.washing system.10., the.countertop portion.18.generally includes a.housing.22.having a pair of.openings.24.,.26., with opening.24.operating as an entrance through which a beverage container is inserted or received prior to performing a washing operation and.opening.26.operating as an exit through which a beverage container is accessed or removed after performing a washing operation. Through the use of.separate openings.24.,.26., handling of unwashed beverage containers by retail establishment employees may be reduced or eliminated. In other embodiments, however, a single entrance/exit opening may be used..Countertop portion.18.also includes a.holder.28.that is disposed within.housing.22.and is configured to hold a beverage container during a washing or sanitizing operation. In addition, and with additional reference to.FIG..3., a number of.assemblies.30.,.32.,.34.are also utilized for performing various actions on the beverage container during a washing or sanitizing operation, and are controlled by a.controller.36., which will be discussed in greater detail below..First, a.spray assembly.30., including one or more sprayers (e.g.,.sprayer.38.as shown in.FIG..2.) is disposed within.housing.22.and configured to spray a wash fluid onto the beverage container while the beverage container is held by.holder.28.. The wash fluid may be water in some instances, while in other instances, the wash fluid may include various agents such as detergents, disinfecting agents, etc. As will become more apparent below, when sanitization is desired, the wash fluid sprayed by the.spray assembly.30.may be heated to a sanitizing temperature, e.g., about 150 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in some embodiments, and about 165 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in some embodiments, and in some instances may be pressurized at a high pressure, e.g., about 100 psi or above. Second, an.ultraviolet sanitizing assembly.32., including one or more ultraviolet lights.40.(one of which is shown in.FIG..2.), is disposed within.housing.22.and configured to emit ultraviolet light toward the beverage container while the beverage container is held by.holder.28.. Third, a.dryer assembly.34., e.g., including one or.more air outlets.42., is disposed within.housing.22.and configured to blow air onto the beverage container while the beverage container is held by.holder.28.. A number of other components in each of these assemblies, as noted above, may be disposed within.cabinet.12., and may be accessed, for example, through one or more cabinet doors.44.(.FIG..1.)..Now turning specifically to.FIG..3.,.washing system.10.may be under the control of a.controller.36.that receives inputs from a number of components and drives a number of components in response thereto..Controller.36.may, for example, include one or.more processors.46.and a.memory.48.within which may be stored program code for execution by the one or.more processors.46.. The memory may be embedded in.controller.36., but may also be considered to include volatile and/or non-volatile memories, cache memories, flash memories, programmable read-only memories, read-only memories, etc., as well as memory storage physically located elsewhere from.controller.36., e.g., in a mass storage device or on a remote computer interfaced with.controller.36...Controller.36.may also be implemented as a microcontroller in some embodiments, and as such these terms are used interchangeably herein..Controller.36.may also include discrete circuit logic in some embodiments, e.g., including passive and/or active circuit components..As shown in.FIG..3.,.controller.36.may be interfaced with various components, including a.spray assembly.30.,.ultraviolet sanitizing assembly.32., and.dryer assembly.34., as well as.housing.22.and/or.holder.28.. In addition, one or more user interfaces.50., e.g., including various input/output devices such as knobs, dials, sliders, switches, buttons, lights, textual and/or graphics displays, touch screen displays, speakers, image capture devices, microphones, etc., may be used for receiving input from and communicating with one or more users. Separate user controls and/or displays may be provided, for example, on or near.housing.22.for a customer and a retail establishment employee (e.g., to start or stop a washing operation), and in some instances, additional controls and/or displays may be provided at different locations, e.g., under.countertop.16.or behind a.cabinet door.44., to perform additional operations, such as initializing and/or shutting off the system, flushing the system, displaying error conditions, etc..In some embodiments,.controller.36.may also be coupled to one or more network interfaces.52., e.g., for interfacing with external devices via wired and/or.wireless networks.54.such as Ethernet, Bluetooth, NFC, cellular and other suitable networks. It may be desirable, for example, to interface with one or more user devices.56., e.g., a customer's mobile phone, to enable a customer to start a washing operation, in some instances in connection with ordering and/or paying for a beverage. It may also be desirable to interface with various backend devices such as a point of sale (POS) system and/or a.remote service.58.. Moreover, in some embodiments, at least a portion of.controller.36.may be implemented externally, e.g., within a mobile device, a cloud computing environment, etc., such that at least a portion of the functionality described herein is implemented within the portion of the controller that is externally implemented..In some embodiments,.controller.36.may operate under the control of an operating system and may execute or otherwise rely upon various computer software applications, components, programs, objects, modules, data structures, etc. In addition,.controller.36.may also incorporate hardware logic to implement some or all of the functionality disclosed herein. Further, in some embodiments, the sequences of operations performed by.controller.36.to implement the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented using program code including one or more instructions that are resident at various times in various memory and storage devices, and that, when read and executed by one or more hardware-based processors, perform the operations embodying desired functionality. Moreover, in some embodiments, such program code may be distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that the invention applies equally regardless of the particular type of computer readable media used to actually carry out the distribution, including, for example, non-transitory computer readable storage media. In addition, it will be appreciated that the various operations described herein may be combined, split, reordered, reversed, varied, omitted, parallelized and/or supplemented with other techniques known in the art, and therefore, the invention is not limited to the particular sequences of operations described herein..As noted above,.controller.36.may be interfaced in some embodiments with one or both of.housing.22.and.holder.28.. In the embodiment illustrated in.FIGS..1.-.2., for example,.washing system.10.includes a concentric housing arrangement, also referred to herein as a concentric dome arrangement, whereby.housing.22.includes an outer.decorative cover.60.coupled with a pair of concentric housing members or.domes.62.,.64.supported by a.base.66.. Concentric housing member or.dome.62.is an outer concentric housing member or dome while concentric housing member or.dome.64.is an inner concentric housing member or dome that is disposed inwardly from outer concentric housing member or.dome.62.and forms at least a portion of a.wash chamber.68.with the base..Entrance opening.24.and.exit opening.26.are defined in outer.concentric housing member.62.while an.additional opening.70.is provided in inner.concentric housing member.64., and a.drive motor.72.is used to rotate inner.concentric housing member.64.to selectively move opening.70.between a loading position where.opening.70.is aligned with entrance opening.24.to provide access to the wash chamber for insertion of the beverage container prior to a washing operation, a washing position where.opening.70.is intermediate entrance and.exit openings.24.,.26.(thereby closing both openings), and an unloading position where.opening.70.is aligned with exit opening.26.to provide access to the wash chamber for removal of the beverage container at the completion of a washing operation..In other embodiments, however, no mechanical manipulation of a housing may be used, whereby.controller.36.may not be electronically coupled to.housing.22.. For example, it may be desirable in some embodiments to keep an entrance opening and an exit opening open at all times, or to use a door or other manually or mechanically actuated closure..In the illustrated embodiment of.FIGS..1.and.2.,.holder.28.may be fixed in location and thus no electronic coupling between.controller.36.and.holder.28.may be used. In other embodiments, however, it may be desirable to configure.holder.28.to electronically open or close, rotate, and/or move, including moving between different stations, so.controller.36.may be electronically coupled to.holder.28.in some embodiments..For example, as illustrated by washing.system.80.of.FIG..4., a.holder.82.may be moved between different stations, e.g., a.loading station.84., a.washing station.86., an.ultraviolet sanitizing station.88., a drying.station.90.and/or an unloading.station.92., e.g., by a.conveyor.94.or other articulating configuration. Further, in some embodiments, multiple actions may be performed at the same station (e.g., drying and exposing to ultraviolet radiation in the same station), or multiple stations may perform different aspects of a particular action (e.g., separate wash and rinse stations)..Now turning to.FIG..5., and as discussed above, beverage.container washing system.10.includes a number of additional components, many of which are in an.undercounter portion.20., that operate each of.spray assembly.30.,.ultraviolet sanitizing assembly.32.and.dryer assembly.34...Spray assembly.30., for example, additionally includes a wash.fluid recirculation assembly.100.that is disposed in.cabinet.12.and underneath.countertop.16.and is in fluid communication with.sprayer.38.through.countertop.16...In particular, in the illustrated embodiment, it is desirable to recirculate wash fluid for use in multiple washing operations to reduce overall water and energy consumption. Rather than utilizing fresh water for each washing operation, the wash fluid may be reused for multiple washing operations, and in some instances, one or more fluid property sensors (e.g., a turbidity sensor and/or a conductivity sensor) may be used to monitor the state of the wash fluid and periodically perform a wash fluid refresh operation to drain at least a portion of the wash fluid to a drain and replace the removed portion with fresh water (referred to herein as make up water)..Wash.fluid recirculation assembly.100., in particular, includes a.tank.102.including first and.second chambers.104.,.106.with a.cross-over.108.that fluidly couples first and.second chambers.104.,.106.to one another..First chamber.104.is generally used to house black water, while.second chamber.106.is used to generally house grey water..Cross-over.108.may be implemented as an inverted conduit that is disposed below the fluid level of the.wash fluid.110.disposed in.tank.102., which generally reduces the amount of solid particles.112.(which generally fall to the bottom of.first chamber.104.and thus below the inlet of the inverted conduit) and floating particles.114.(which generally float in.first chamber.104.and thus above the inlet of the inverted conduit) that are drawn into.second chamber.106.. A.collector.116.in.base.66.of.housing.22.collects wash fluid sprayed by.sprayer.38., and the collected wash fluid is conveyed by a.collector line.118.to.first chamber.104.of.tank.102...Each.chamber.104.,.106.has an associated drain or.outlet.120.,.122., and.tank.102.further includes a.heater.124., e.g., a reheating element, that maintains the temperature of.wash fluid.110.above the desired sanitizing temperature. Respective drain devices such as.dump valves.126.,.128.(also referred to as valves V.1.and V.2.) are coupled to.outlets.120.,.122.and feed to a.drain.130., e.g., in the building plumbing system. Dump.valve.126.in some embodiments may also include an.overflow line.132.to collect wash fluid when the fluid level rises above a predetermined level. In some embodiments, drain devices other than valves may be used in other embodiments, e.g., drain pumps, and in some embodiments, overflow may be controlled by a separate float that activates a drain pump..A check valve.134.(also denoted as C.1.) is coupled between.outlet.122.and dump.valve.128.to route wash fluid to a.filter.136.and then onward to a.pump.138.through a.recirculation line.140., and pump.138.pressurizes the wash fluid (e.g., to a pressure about 100 psi or above in some embodiments, and in some embodiments about 150 psi or above) and outputs the pressurized wash fluid to sprayer.38.through a.sprayer supply line.142.. In some embodiments, pump.138.may be a multi-stage pump, e.g., 1 hp, 17-stage pump. During a washing operation, wash fluid in the.second chamber.106.of.tank.102.is thus drawn out of.outlet.122.and through.filter.136.by.pump.138., and then pressurized and supplied to sprayer.38.by.pump.138.. The wash fluid emitted by.sprayer.38.is then collected in.collector.116.of.base.66.and returned to.first chamber.104.of.tank.102...Fresh or make up water is supplied to.tank.102.by a make up.water line.144.. In order to supply the fresh or make up water at a suitable temperature for washing or sanitizing operations, fresh water from a hot water supply.146.(e.g., output by a building water heater) may first be passed through a.water heater booster.148., which maintains a quantity of water at an elevated temperature (e.g., about 150 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in some embodiments, and about 165 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in some embodiments). In other embodiments, however, fresh water may be supplied from a cold water supply and heated by water heater booster, and in some embodiments,.water heater booster.148.may be omitted, with the temperature of the wash fluid in.tank.102.predominantly controlled by reheating.element.124...Four additional valves, e.g.,.solenoid valves.150.,.152.,.154.and.156.(also denoted respectively as valves S.1.-S.4.), may also be incorporated into.assembly.100...Valve.150.is a make up water valve, and is provided in make up.water line.144.to control the supply of make up water to.first chamber.104.of.tank.102...Valve.156.is disposed in.sprayer supply line.142., and is actuated when.pump.138.is actuated to supply wash fluid to.sprayer.38...In addition, in the illustrated embodiment,.filter.136.is a flushable filter and includes a second, cleanout outlet.158., and.valve.152.is configured as a cleanout valve that couples cleanout outlet.158.to drain.130...Valve.154.in turn is configured as a filter clean valve that is coupled to make up.water line.144.to supply fresh water to.recirculation line.140.upstream of a.filter element.160.of.filter.136.through a fresh.water supply line.162.. It will be appreciated that when.valves.152.,.154.are closed and pump.138.is running wash fluid from.tank.102.flows through an upstream portion of.recirculation line.140., through.filter element.160., and through the first outlet of the filter and a downstream portion of the.recirculation line.140.to pump.138.. However, whenever it is desirable to perform a filter cleaning operation (generally while.pump.138.is shut off),.valves.152.and.154.may be opened to supply fresh water to an outside or upstream side of the.filter element.160.and then out cleanout outlet.158.to run fresh water over the outside of the filter element and flush any debris on the filter element into.drain.130.. In addition, in some embodiments, a check valve.164.(also denoted as C.2.) and a.vacuum breaker.165.may also be provided in fresh.water supply line.162.to inhibit reverse fluid flow to the make up.water line.144.. In other embodiments, gray water may be used to clean the filter, e.g., by coupling.line.162.to an outlet of.pump.138.instead of to a fresh water source, e.g., between.pump.138.and.valve.156., and with an additional valve controlling fluid flow through.line.162...Assembly.100.may also include a number of sensors to monitor the operation of the assembly and initiate various actions in response thereto. A.fluid level sensor.166.may be disposed in.tank.102.to sense a fluid level therein, and the controller may utilize the output of this sensor to control make up.water valve.150.to maintain a desired fluid level in the tank. A.temperature sensor.168.may be disposed in.tank.102.to sense the wash fluid temperature, and the controller may utilize the output of this sensor to control reheating.element.124.to regulate the wash fluid temperature in the tank. One or more fluid property sensors, e.g., a.turbidity sensor.170., a conductivity sensor, and/or another sensor suitable for measuring various fluid properties, may also be disposed in.tank.102., e.g., in.second chamber.106., or otherwise disposed elsewhere in.assembly.100., to sense the water quality and/or cleanliness of the wash fluid, and the controller may utilize the output of this sensor to trigger a wash fluid refresh operation that drains at least a portion of the wash fluid to drain.130.and adds fresh water to.tank.102...A pair of.pressure sensors.172.,.174.(also denoted as P.1.and P.2.) may also be disposed upstream and downstream of filter element.160.(e.g., within upstream and downstream portions of recirculation line.140.), and the controller may utilize the outputs of these sensors to sense a pressure differential indicative of a dirty or clogged filter element, and thereby trigger a filter cleaning operation. An additional pressure sensor.176.(also denoted as P.3.) and a.flowmeter.178.may also be disposed downstream of.pump.138., e.g., in.sprayer supply line.142., and the controller may use the outputs of these sensors to monitor the supply of wash fluid to.sprayer.38.. As will also be discussed in greater detail below, a dryer assembly may also include one or more blowers, e.g., a.blower.180., that supply air to one or more air knives..FIG..6.next illustrates an example sequence of.operations.200.capable of being performed by.controller.36.of beverage.container washing system.10.to perform washing operations in a manner consistent with some embodiments of the invention. It is assumed that.washing system.10.includes three positions, a loading position where the washing system is configured to allow a customer to insert a beverage container into the holder in the wash chamber (e.g., through entrance opening.24.of.FIG..2.), a washing position where the washing system is configured to perform a washing operation (e.g., with entrance and.exit openings.24.,.26.closed), and an unloading position where the washing system is configured to allow an employee to remove a beverage container from the holder in the wash chamber (e.g., through exit opening.26.of.FIG..1.). It is also assumed that at the beginning of.sequence.200., the.washing system.10.is in the loading position, and a customer has inserted a beverage container into the holder in the wash chamber. In addition, it will be appreciated that during this time, reheating element.124.(e.g., as a result of a background process executing in a controller, or in a dedicated circuit) may also be cycled to maintain the fluid temperature in the tank at a desired level..Sequence.200.may be initiated, for example, in response to selection of a start control by a customer or employee, e.g., on a physical user interface provided on the washing system, via a foot pedal or switch, via a gesture or audible command, on a display of a POS system, on an app running on a mobile device, or another suitable manner for starting a washing operation. In.block.202., activation of the control is detected, and in.block.204., the washing system is moved from the loading position to the washing position (e.g., by rotating inner.concentric housing member.64.with drive motor.72.)..Next, in.block.206., the pump of the spray assembly and the UV lights of the ultraviolet sanitizing assembly are activated to initiate spraying of the beverage container by.sprayer.38.and irradiation of the beverage container with ultraviolet light (in another embodiment, the spray assembly and UV lights may be activated sequentially rather than concurrently). In addition, during this time pressure sensors.172.-.176.and.flowmeter.178.are monitored to track the output flow of.pump.138., as well as to monitor the pressure differential on the upstream and downstream sides of.filter.136...After some period of time, the pump is shut off and.blower.180.of the dryer assembly is activated in.block.208.to transition between washing the beverage container and drying the beverage container. Then, in.block.210., the turbidity (or another property of the wash fluid) is sensed using.sensor.170., and thereafter, the blower and UV lights are shut off in.block.212., whereby the washing or sanitizing operation is complete..Next, in.block.214., the washing system is moved from the washing position to the unloading position (e.g., by rotating inner.concentric housing member.64.with drive motor.72.) to enable the beverage container to be removed from the holder in the wash chamber. Confirmation of removal of the beverage container is obtained in.block.216.by detecting activation of an appropriate control (e.g., the same control used to start the washing operation in.block.202.or a different control)..Blocks.218.and.220.then determine whether conditions were detected indicating the need for either or both of a wash fluid refresh operation and a filter clean operation, and if neither operation is needed, control passes to block.222.to move the washing system from the unloading position to the loading position (e.g., by rotating inner.concentric housing member.64.with drive motor.72.) to prepare the washing system for a next washing operation. It will be appreciated that in embodiments where the loading and unloading positions are the same, block.222.may be omitted..Block.224.then determines, e.g., using.fluid level sensor.166., whether the wash fluid level in the tank is below a threshold (e.g., where the wash fluid level has dropped below a minimum level), and assuming not, performance of.sequence.200.is complete..Returning to block.218., this block determines whether a need exists for a wash fluid refresh operation by determining if the turbidity sensed in block.210.(or another sensed fluid property) meets a threshold, e.g., where the turbidity of the wash fluid exceeds a level for which it is desired to flush at least a portion of the wash fluid from the tank and replace it with fresh water. If so, block.218.passes control to block.226.to perform a wash fluid refresh operation. In such an operation, one or both of.dump valves.126.and.128.(or drain pumps, if used) may be actuated to drain at least a portion of the wash fluid in.tank.102., and make up.water valve.150.may be actuated to add make up water to the tank. In addition, during such an operation the filter may be cleaned concurrently with the flushing and refilling of wash fluid in some embodiments..In one example embodiment, a wash fluid refresh operation may incorporate the following sequence of actions:.1. Position washing system in wash position.2. Open valve.126.(V.1.) and valve.152.(S.2.).3. Wait 3 Sec.4. Open valve.128.(V.2.).5. Wait 3 Sec.6. Open valve.154.(S.3.) and valve.150.(S.1.).7. Wait 5 Sec.8. Close valve.126.(V.1.) and valve.152.(S.2.).9. Wait 5 Sec.10. Close valve.154.(S.3.).11. Wait 10 Sec.12. Close valve.128.(V.2.).13. Fill until.fluid level sensor.166.indicates full tank.14..Run pump.138.for 10 Sec.15. Wait 5 Sec.16. Recheck turbidity, and if turbidity is below threshold, return washing system to load position for next washing operation, otherwise repeat steps 1-16.It will be appreciated that other sequences may be used in other embodiments. Moreover, while in some embodiments a wash fluid refresh operation may replace all wash fluid with fresh water, in other embodiments only a portion of the wash fluid may be flushed and replaced with fresh water..Returning to block.220., the block determines whether a need exists for a filter cleaning operation by determining if the pressure differential between.pressure sensors.172.,.174.meets a threshold, e.g., a pressure differential greater than some threshold that indicates that fluid flow through the filter has been impeded to an extent that cleaning of the filter is desirable. If so, block.220.passes control to block.228.to clean the filter, e.g., by actuating.cleanout valve.152.and filter.clean valve.154.to run fresh water over the outer surface of the filter element..In one example embodiment, a filter cleaning operation may incorporate the following sequence of actions:.1. Open valve.152.(S.2.).2. Wait 3 Sec.3. Open valve.154.(S.3.) for 5 seconds and then close.4. Wait 3 Sec.5. Close valve.152.(S.2.).6. Check wash fluid level and fill as needed.Returning to block.224., the block determines whether a need exists to add make up water to the tank by determining if the wash fluid level sensed by.fluid level sensor.166.meets a threshold, e.g., is below a minimum fluid level. If so, block.224.passes control to block.230.to actuate make up.water valve.150.to add makeup water, until the fluid level sensor indicates that the tank is full, whereby.valve.150.may be shut off. In some embodiments, block.224.may be performed at the same time as.blocks.218.and.220.; however, it may be desirable to defer block.224.to allow for wash fluid in the wash chamber to have time to fully drain into the tank before checking the fluid level in the tank..It will be appreciated that, assuming none of the supplemental operations of.blocks.226.,.228.and.230.are required, the bulk of the runtime of a washing operation is occupied by the washing, UV sanitizing and drying actions performed in blocks.206.-.212., and it will also be appreciated that the UV sanitizing action overlaps in time with each of the washing and drying actions, such that, for example, if the washing action takes X seconds and the drying action takes Y seconds, the UV sanitizing action takes ZXY seconds. In other embodiments, particularly where a holder is moved between multiple stations, however, the UV sanitizing action may overlap only a portion of one or both of the washing and drying actions, or may not overlap with either of the washing and drying actions at all. In addition, it will be appreciated that moving between the loading, washing, and unloading positions may also occupy some time within a washing operation in some embodiments. It may be desirable in some embodiments, for example, to provide a washing operation having a duration of about 45 seconds or less, with, for example, about 5 seconds used to move from the loading position to the washing position, about 30 seconds for the washing action, about 5 seconds for the drying action, about 30 seconds for the UV sanitizing action (concurrent with the washing action, or alternatively in another embodiment about 35 seconds concurrently with both the washing and drying actions), and about 5 seconds to move from the washing position to the unloading position..It will be appreciated that.washing system.10.may vary in other embodiments in a number of manners. For example, an additional filter may be used in.first chamber.104.of.tank.102.in some embodiments to filter wash fluid before it is transferred to.second chamber.106.. Further, in some embodiments, a separate rinse action may be performed using a source of fresh water after the washing action. Further, in some embodiments, one or more disinfecting agents, e.g., various hypochlorite sanitizing compositions, may be introduced into.tank.102.and maintained at a minimum level based upon sensing by a suitable sensor. In addition, further operations, such as startup operations that initialize the washing system, and shutdown operations that flush the washing system and shut down all components, may also be supported..Concentric Housing Members.As noted above, while in some embodiments a holder may be movable between a plurality of stations during a washing operation, in other embodiments it may be desirable to utilize a holder that maintains the beverage container in a single location while various actions associated with a washing operation (e.g., loading, unloading, washing, rinsing, UV sanitization and/or drying) are performed. Furthermore, while in some embodiments a beverage container may be inserted into and removed from a beverage container washing system through a single opening, in other embodiments it may be desirable to utilize a housing configuration that enables a beverage container to be inserted into a washing system and removed from the washing system through separate openings, e.g., in a retail environment such that a customer may insert an unwashed beverage container into one side of a washing system built into or supported on a retail counter and an employee may remove the beverage container from the other side of the washing system after washing is complete, thereby minimizing employee contact with unwashed customer beverage containers..To address these concerns, it may be desirable to utilize a washing system design that incorporates a pair of concentric housing members that are supported on a base, with an inner one of the concentric housing members being disposed inwardly from the outer one of the concentric housing members and forming at least a portion of a wash chamber, and with each of the concentric housing members including an opening. At least one of the concentric housing members may also be rotatable about an axis of rotation, e.g., under the control of a drive assembly, to selectively align the respective openings in the inner and outer concentric housing members to either enable or inhibit access to the wash chamber, e.g., to enable a user to insert or remove a beverage container into or from a holder disposed in the wash chamber when the openings are aligned, or to restrict external access to the holder in the wash chamber during the washing operation, and in some instances, prevent any wash fluid sprayed in the wash chamber during the washing operation from escaping from the washing system..In some instances, the axis of rotation may be vertical, and moreover, in some instances, multiple openings may be provided in either or both of the inner and outer concentric housing members to provide different points of access to the wash chamber (e.g., to provide separate openings for a customer and an employee, or otherwise provide separate openings on different sides of a washing system). Further, while in some embodiments, only a single concentric housing member may be rotatable, with the other concentric housing member remaining fixed or stationary, in other embodiments, both concentric housing members may be rotatable..Beverage.container washing system.10.of.FIGS..1.-.2.illustrates such a concentric housing member arrangement, where.concentric housing member.62.and outer.concentric housing member.64.are configured as concentric domes that are generally dome shaped and have generally cylindrical sidewalls. It will be appreciated, however, that the concentric housing members can have a wide variety of alternate shapes, sizes and configurations, so the invention is not limited to the concentric dome configuration illustrated herein. As one example, in one embodiment an inner concentric housing member may have an open-top, e.g., configured as a cylinder, such that the top of the wash chamber is defined at least in part by the outer concentric housing member. By doing so, drying, spraying and/or ultraviolet sanitization actions may be performed at least in part by stationary components operating from an overhead position and not requiring electrical or other connections to a movable concentric housing member..With further reference to.FIGS..7.-.9., each.concentric housing member.62.,.64.fully circumscribes an axis of rotation A, and among the.concentric housing members.62.,.64., inner.concentric housing member.62.is rotatable while outer.concentric housing member.64.is fixed or stationary. An.entrance opening.24.and.exit opening.26.are defined on opposite sides of outer.concentric housing member.62.while an.additional opening.70.is provided in inner.concentric housing member.64., and a.drive motor.72.is used to rotate inner.concentric housing member.64.to selectively move opening.70.between a loading position where.opening.70.is aligned with entrance opening.24.to provide access to the wash chamber for insertion of the beverage container prior to a washing operation (.FIG..7.), a washing position where.opening.70.is intermediate entrance and.exit openings.24.,.26.(thereby effectively closing both openings as shown in.FIG..8.), and an unloading position where.opening.70.is aligned with exit opening.26.to provide access to the wash chamber for removal of the beverage container at the completion of a washing operation (.FIG..9.). The loading, washing and unloading positions represent different relative positions between the two.concentric housing members.62.,.64...It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the mere alignment or misalignment of.opening.70.and entrance and.exit openings.24.,.26.may be sufficient to inhibit the escape of wash fluid from.wash chamber.68.. It should also be noted that opening.70.as illustrated in the figures does project radially from the inner cylindrical wall defining the wash chamber such that an edge of opening.70.may touch or at least define a reduced gap between.opening.70.and the inner cylindrical wall of outer.concentric housing member.64.. In other embodiments, however, it may be desirable to also include a sealing arrangement on one or both of.concentric housing members.62.,.64.(e.g., around one or more of.openings.24.,.26.and.70.) to further inhibit the escape of wash fluid from.wash chamber.68...With additional reference to.FIG..10., drive.motor.72.may be incorporated into a.drive assembly.250.that further includes a pair of.gears.252.,.254.configured to drive rotation of inner.concentric housing member.62.with.drive motor.72.. Drive.motor.72.may be an electric, e.g. a DC motor, and drive.motor.72.and.gear.252.may be disposed in a.compartment.256.formed in outer.concentric housing member.64., and may be accessed through a.cover.258...Gear.254.may be coupled to inner.concentric housing member.62., and in some embodiments, may circumscribe the perimeter of the inner concentric housing member. In some embodiments,.gear.254.may also be formed integrally with inner.concentric housing member.62.. In another embodiment,.gear.254.may be formed as an internal ring gear and may be driven from a point inward from inner.concentric housing member.62.. Inner.concentric housing member.62.may be rotatably supported on a.turntable bearing.260.. In other embodiments, other drive assembly configurations may be used to drive rotation of inner.concentric housing member.62., e.g., a friction wheel drive assembly, a belt or chain drive, a piston or linear motor drive, etc. Particularly where rotation is limited to only about 90 degrees, as may be the case when two openings are provided in inner.concentric housing member.62., various mechanical arrangements, including linear drives, may be used to impart sufficient rotation to the inner concentric housing member..Furthermore, in order to controllably rotate inner.concentric housing member.62.between the different relative positions, a position detector, e.g., an encoder or other suitable position sensor, may be used. In one embodiment, for example, a position detector may be implemented by a set of stationary three.reed switches.262.,.264.,.266.configured to sense a.magnet.268.coupled to inner.concentric housing member.62.when the.opening.70.is in each of the loading, washing and unloading positions. Other position detector configurations may be used in other embodiments, however, so it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the particular configuration illustrated in.FIG..10...Dryer Assembly.As noted above in connection with.FIGS..1.-.2., it may also be desirable in some embodiments to incorporate a dryer assembly in a beverage container washing system, e.g., to blow off any standing wash fluid, water or other moisture left on the beverage container subsequent to spraying by a spraying assembly. It will be appreciated, however, that where the housing of the beverage container washing system incorporates movable components, supplying a flow air to the beverage container can be complicated by the need to supply the air in a manner that accommodates the movable components..In the specific case of beverage.container washing system.10., which incorporates a rotatable inner.concentric housing member.62., for example, it is generally desirable to provide a flow of air to wash.chamber.68., but do so in a manner that accommodates the rotatable nature of inner.concentric housing member.62...In the illustrated embodiment, and with further reference to.FIGS..11.-.12.(note that outer.concentric housing member.64.has been omitted from.FIG..11.), a dryer assembly may include an.air knife chamber.300.disposed proximate a top of inner.concentric housing member.62...Air knife chamber.300.is defined in part by an.outer shell.302., which, in some embodiments, may be integrally molded or formed with inner.concentric housing member.62., while in other embodiments, may be welded, fastened, or otherwise secured to a wall of inner.concentric housing member.62.such that the.outer shell.302.covers at least a portion of the wall of the inner concentric housing member. In the illustrated embodiment,.outer shell.302.and.air knife chamber.300.are configured to rotate with the inner concentric housing member, while in other embodiments,.outer shell.302.and.air knife chamber.300.may be stationary, such that inner.concentric housing member.62.rotates relative to the outer shell and the air knife chamber..One or more.air knife openings.304.are defined in inner concentric housing member and are in fluid communication with.air knife chamber.300.to direct a flow of air toward a.beverage container.280.while the beverage container is held by.holder.28.in.wash chamber.68.. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, an annular arrangement of four radially-offset and arcuate air knife openings.304.(which at least partially circumscribe the axis of rotation A) are used, which are separated from one another by four.tabs.306.that support a.central hub.308.having a.central nipple.310.. As seen in.FIG..12., the shape of.central hub.308.and.central nipple.310.serves to distribute air flow radially outwardly to the.air knife openings.304.that are radially-offset from the axis of rotation A. Moreover, in the illustrated embodiment, central nipple is upwardly-facing and axially aligned with the axis of rotation A..Air is suppled to.air knife chamber.300.from a stationary.air supply conduit.312.that is in fluid communication with.blower.180.to receive a supply of pressurized air. In the illustrated embodiment, at least a portion of.conduit.312.extends substantially vertically along a side of outer.concentric housing member.64., around a top side of outer.concentric housing member.64., and then through an.opening.314.formed in the top side of outer.concentric housing member.64...Air knife chamber.300.is in fluid communication with stationary.air supply conduit.312.through a.rotary seal.316., which in the illustrated embodiment is formed by a three.concentric tubes.318.,.320.,.322.that are all axially aligned with the axis of rotation.A. Concentric tube.318.is an upwardly-facing tube that defines an air inlet for.air knife chamber.300., while.concentric tube.320.is a downwardly-facing tube that extends downwardly from stationary.air supply conduit.312.and forms an air outlet therefor..Concentric tube.322.is also downwardly-facing, but extends downwardly from outer.concentric housing member.64.and defines.opening.314.. In the illustrated embodiment,.concentric tube.322.is inward of.concentric tube.318., and.concentric tube.320.is inward of.concentric tube.322., with at least portions of all three concentric tubes overlapping with one another to form the rotary seal. Moreover, in some embodiments,.rotary seal.316.also functions as an axle for rotation of inner.concentric housing member.62.to rotate about axis of rotation A. As such, air from stationary.air supply conduit.312.may be provided to wash.chamber.68.through rotating.concentric housing member.62...It will be appreciated that other rotary seals may be used in other embodiments, so the invention is not limited to the concentric tube arrangement illustrated in.FIGS..11.-.12.. Moreover, it will be appreciated that a wide variety of alternate numbers and configurations of air knife openings may be used in other embodiments, e.g., to direct air in multiple directions and at other regions of a beverage container, including, in some embodiments, an interior of the beverage container. Additional stationary air knife openings may also be used in some embodiments, e.g., directed upwardly from.base.66., and in some embodiments, no movable air knives may be used, or drying may not be supported whatsoever in a cup washing system. Where an inner concentric housing member has an open top, as another example, stationary air knives may be used in lieu of the configuration illustrated in.FIGS..11.-.12.. Further, air knife openings may be configured in other manners in other embodiments, e.g., using nozzles capable of controlling direction, flow rate and/or spray pattern, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the instant disclosure..Ultraviolet Sanitizing Assembly.As also noted above in connection with.FIGS..1.-.2., it may also be desirable in some embodiments to incorporate an ultraviolet sanitizing assembly in a beverage container washing system, e.g., to sanitize an outer and/or inner surface of a beverage container by irradiating it with ultraviolet light. It will be appreciated, however, that where the housing of the beverage container washing system incorporates movable components, supplying power to ultraviolet lights mounted to such movable components can be complicated by the need to supply the power in a manner that accommodates the movable components. In the specific case of beverage.container washing system.10., which incorporates a rotatable inner.concentric housing member.62., for example, it may be desirable to provide one or more.ultraviolet lights.40.within.wash chamber.68., but do so in a manner that accommodates the rotatable nature of inner.concentric housing member.62...Ultraviolet sanitizing lights, which are generally formed by arrays of ultraviolet (UV) light emitting diodes (LEDs), or alternatively by other devices capable of emitting ultraviolet light (e.g., incandescent or halogen lights), are susceptible to being attenuated by materials lacking sufficient transmissivity to ultraviolet wavelengths, and in some instances, UV LEDs may require special materials that offer a unique transmissivity, as the UV light may be attenuated even by some visually translucent materials. As such, it may be desirable in some embodiments to avoid the high cost of creating large parts that are UV light transmissive by restricting the amount of material between the UV LEDs and the beverage container to be sanitized. In the illustrated embodiment, therefore, incorporating UV LEDs into the inner.concentric housing member.62.may reduce potential transmissivity issues, and may even allow for the inner.concentric housing member.62.to be formed from a material that is translucent or transparent to visible light but that is more opaque to ultraviolet light. Various materials that may be used in some embodiments are polycarbonate, acrylic, standard Glass, etc., although other materials may be used. In some instances, this may even provide a pleasing visual effect for users, as the visual light emitted by the UV LEDs may be visible through the inner (and outer, if formed of a similar material).concentric housing member.62., while still blocking user exposure to ultraviolet wavelengths..In the illustrated embodiment, and with continuing reference to.FIGS..11.-.12.(note that outer.concentric housing member.64.has been omitted from.FIG..11.), an ultraviolet sanitizing assembly may include one or more.ultraviolet lights.40.that are coupled to a rotatable concentric housing member, in this case inner.concentric housing member.62.. As noted above, while.ultraviolet lights.40.may be implemented using one or more UV LEDs, in other embodiments, other devices capable of emitting ultraviolet light (e.g., incandescent or halogen lights) may also be used. In other embodiments, e.g., where an outer concentric housing member is rotatable, one or more ultraviolet lights may be mounted to an outer concentric housing member. Further, in some embodiments, additional ultraviolet lights may be located in fixed or stationary locations, e.g., as illustrated in.FIG..12.by ultraviolet light.330.on outer.concentric housing member.64., as illustrated in.FIG..12.by.ultraviolet light.332.in.collector.116., or in other locations such as the space between.concentric housing members.62.,.64...It should be noted that in some embodiments ultraviolet light.330.may be positioned on outer.concentric housing member.64.such that opening.70.of inner.concentric housing member.62.faces ultraviolet light.330.when in the washing position, such that three.ultraviolet lights.40.may be disposed on inner.concentric housing member.62., and with all four.ultraviolet lights.40.,.330.evenly spaced in 90 degree increments about the axis of rotation to provide relatively full coverage of the outer surface of.beverage container.280.. It should also be noted that some ultraviolet lights, e.g.,.ultraviolet light.332., may be positioned to irradiate an inner surface of.beverage container.280...In order to power.ultraviolet lights.40., a.slip ring.334.may be coupled between inner and outer.concentric housing members.62.,.64., with, for example, a.rotatable portion.336.coupled to inner.concentric housing member.62.and a stationary portion coupled to outer.concentric housing member.64...Slip ring.334.may utilize various electromechanical constructions, including rotary electrical contacts, commutators, rotary transformers, rotary unions, pancake slip rings, wireless slip rings, etc., and wiring harnesses (not shown) both on the stationary and rotatable sides of the slip ring may be used to route the electrical power to each.ultraviolet light.40.. Further,.slip ring.334.may be positioned elsewhere within.housing.22., e.g., along the top or side wall of inner.concentric housing member.62., at the base of inner.concentric housing member.62., etc..Various ultraviolet light constructions may be used for.ultraviolet lights.40.in different embodiments. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, each.ultraviolet light.40.may extend substantially vertically along a side wall of inner.concentric housing member.62., and in some instances, and as best illustrated in.FIGS..7.-.9., the inner.concentric housing member.62.may include a substantially vertical mounting.arrangement.340.configured to receive each.ultraviolet light.40...The mounting.arrangement.340.in some embodiments may include an.ultraviolet transmissive cover.342.that overlays.ultraviolet light.40.to permit ultraviolet light transmission into.wash chamber.68., and that further seals the ultraviolet light from the wash chamber. In some instances, the.cover.342.may be mounted, welded or otherwise secured to inner.concentric housing member.62., while in other instances, the cover may be integrally molded thereto. In either instance, it is generally desirable for the other walls of inner.concentric housing member.62.to be formed of an ultraviolet blocking material that inhibits ultraviolet light transmission through the walls of inner.concentric housing member.62...The mounting arrangement may.340.may also include one or.more openings.344.formed in a wall of inner.concentric housing member.62.and aligned with a plurality of.UV LEDs.346.disposed on a.circuit board.348.. By doing so,.circuit board.348.may be positioned on an outer surface of inner.concentric housing member.62., with the.UV LEDs.346.positioned to emit ultraviolet light through.openings.344.. In addition, in some embodiments, it may also be desirable to incorporate a.heat sink.350., which may run along a portion or the entire length of.circuit board.348.and be thermally coupled thereto, and serve to further seal the circuit board from the surrounding environment..It will be appreciated that different numbers and/or orientations of ultraviolet lights may be used in other embodiments, e.g., two ultraviolet lights having respective angular positions about the axis of rotation A spaced about 90 to about 180 degrees, or less, from one another, three ultraviolet lights having respective angular positions about the axis of rotation A spaced about 90 to about 120 degrees from one another, four ultraviolet lights having respective angular positions about the axis of rotation A spaced about 90 degrees or less from one another, etc. In one example embodiment, for example, two opposing ultraviolet lights may be supported on inner.concentric housing member.62.and two opposing ultraviolet lights may be supported on outer.concentric housing member.64.such that ultraviolet lights are oriented in 90 degree increments when the inner.concentric housing member.62.is in the washing position..Holder.Now turning to.FIG..13., one example implementation of.holder.28.is illustrated in greater detail..Holder.28.is configured to be positioned within.wash chamber.68.and to hold a beverage container in an inverted orientation during a washing or sanitizing operation. In the illustrated embodiment,.holder.28.includes a base.360.that is configured to support a beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder in the inverted orientation, and a.retainer.362.configured to support a sidewall of the beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder in the inverted orientation..Retainer.362.in particular restricts lateral movement of the beverage container during the washing or sanitizing operation, and includes a.lateral opening.364.through which the beverage container may be passed during insertion into and/or removal from the holder. The design of.retainer.362.as illustrated in.FIG..13., in particular, attempts to provide minimal surface contact with washed beverage containers to maximize exposure to wash fluid and/or ultraviolet radiation. In some embodiments, a beverage container may even be allowed to rotate or otherwise wiggle around somewhat while being held by the retainer as a result of being sprayed such that the areas of the beverage container that are contacted by the retainer may change from time to time during a washing operation..Base.360.is desirably adapted to support beverage containers having various diameter mouths or openings..FIG..14., for example, illustrates a narrow.mouth beverage container.366.held by.holder.28.and supported by.base.360., while.FIG..15.illustrates a wide.mouth beverage container.368.held by.holder.28.and supported by.base.360...In the illustrated embodiment, for example,.base.360.includes a substantially.vertical portion.370.that projects upwardly towards the beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder in the inverted orientation, and that defines a first annular support that may be used to support beverage containers having mouths or openings that are smaller than a predetermined amount, such that a narrow mouth beverage container such as.beverage container.366.of.FIG..14.is supported on a.shoulder.374.thereof..Base.360.also includes a substantially.horizontal portion.372.that is disposed radially outwardly from the substantially.vertical portion.370., and that defines a second annular support that may be used to support beverage containers having mouths or openings that are larger than a predetermined amount, such that a wide mouth beverage container such as.beverage container.368.of.FIG..15.is supported on a.lip.376.thereof. It should be appreciated also that, when a narrow mouth beverage container such as.beverage container.366.of.FIG..14.is supported by.base.360., substantially.vertical portion.370.extends externally to the beverage container, but when a wide mouth beverage container such as.beverage container.368.of.FIG..15.is supported by.base.360., substantially.vertical portion.370.extends internally to the beverage container. In both configurations, however, in the illustrated embodiment it will be appreciated that the lip or shoulder of a beverage container generally contacts the base at four points, arranged in a rectangular or diamond arrangement, which minimizes the amount of the lip that is blocked from spray and/or ultraviolet irradiation at any point in time..Also, in the illustrated embodiment,.retainer.362.includes a pair of opposing.grippers.378.,.380.. Each.gripper.378.,.380.includes a.container engaging portion.382.,.384.that is configured to engage the sidewall of the beverage container (e.g., sidewalls.386.,.388.of.beverage containers.366.,.368.of.FIGS..14.and.15.), and each is movable between respective first and second positions, where in the first positions the.container engaging portions.382.,.384.are closer to one another than when in the second positions, and the.lateral opening.364.is thus narrower when the.container engaging portions.382.,.384.are in the first positions than when in the second positions..FIG..13., for example, illustrates.grippers.378.,.380.in their first positions and.FIGS..14.and.15.illustrate.grippers.378.,.380.in positions generally corresponding to the second positions, and it should be noted that movement of a gripper from its first position to its second position generally increases the lateral separation between the.container engaging portions.382.,.384.of.grippers.378.,.380...Each.gripper.378.,.380.is supported on.holder.28.through a.hinge.390.,.392., each of which pivots about a respective pivot axis B, C such that each of.grippers.378.,.380.moves between its respective first and second positions at least partially through rotation about the respective pivot axis B, C of.hinge.390.,.392.. Moreover, in the illustrated embodiment, each.hinge.390.is a spring-loaded hinge that biases each.gripper.378.,.380.to its first position as shown in.FIG..13.. While the invention is not so limited, each.hinge.390.,.392.is supported by.base.360.and pivot axes B, C are substantially horizontally oriented and substantially parallel to one another. It will be appreciated that other mechanisms for biasing each gripper may be used in other embodiments, and that other manners of supporting each gripper for movement between different positions (e.g., incorporating some degree of linear movement) may be used in other embodiments..Each.gripper.378.,.380.also includes a pair of.wing portions.394.,.396.,.398.,.400.that are used to facilitate insertion of a beverage container into the holder..Wing portions.394.,.398.are disposed on a first side of.lateral opening.364.and.wing portions.396.,.400.are disposed on a second, opposite side of.lateral opening.364., and each wing portion.394.-.400.is inclined relative to an insertion direction such that when the beverage container is pushed into the lateral opening and against the wing portions (.wing portions.394.,.398.on one side of.lateral opening.364., and.wing portions.396.,.400.on the other side of lateral opening.364.),.grippers.378.,.380.are urged toward their respective second positions..Holder.360.may be formed using various materials, and is desirably formed of materials that are water and rust resistant. Further,.holder.360.desirably has a construction that minimizes the amount of surface area of the beverage container that is blocked from ultraviolet radiation and/or spray of wash fluid while the beverage container is held by the holder. In the illustrated embodiment, for example,.holder.360.is predominantly formed of a wire frame, e.g., a cast metal or welded stainless steel wire frame including a truss-like support structure..Base.360., for example, may include a pair of.rings.402.,.404.defining a perimeter of the base and supporting a plurality of (e.g., four).wires.406.,.408.,.410.,.412.that effectively define the substantially.vertical portion.370.and substantially.horizontal portion.372.of.base.360.through corresponding horizontal and vertical portions of each wire, e.g., as shown in.FIG..13.. Each wire.406.-.412.may also include an inclined end in some embodiments to adapt to the shoulder of a narrow mount beverage container..Also, in the illustrated embodiment, each.container engaging portion.382.,.384.includes a set of four.contact points.414.A-D,.416.A-D disposed in a substantially rectangular or diamond arrangement. Moreover, due to the pivoting nature of.grippers.378.,.380., depending upon the diameter of the beverage container held by the holder, all eight.contact points.414.A-D,.416.A-D may contact the sidewall of the beverage container, or only a subset of four of contact points.414.A-D,.416.A-D may contact the sidewall of the beverage container..Beverage container.366.of.FIG..14., for example, has a smaller diameter, and as a result is contacted only by the upper contact points.414.A,.414.B,.416.A and.416.B, while.beverage container.368.of.FIG..15.has a larger diameter, and as a result is contacted only by the lower contact points.414.C,.414.D,.416.C and.416.D..With additional reference to.FIG..16., each.container engaging portion.382.in the illustrated embodiment may include a pair of generally.vertical members.418.A-B,.420.A-B that are joined to one another by a pair of crossing.diagonal members.422.A-B,.424.A-B, with the contact points.414.A-D,.416.A-D defined at the intersections of these.various members.418.A-B,.420.A-B,.422.A-B and.424.A-B. Moreover, in the illustrated embodiment,.members.418.A-B,.420.A-B,.422.A-B and.424.A-B are bowed away from a beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder in the inverted orientation, thereby minimizing the amount of surface area of the beverage container that is blocked by the structure of each gripper..FIGS..17.-.23.illustrate a number of alternate holder designs that may be used in other embodiments..FIG..17., for example, illustrates a.different holder.420.that includes a base.422.configured to support a beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder in the inverted orientation, and a.retainer.424.configured to support a sidewall of the beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder in the inverted orientation to restrict lateral movement of the beverage container during the washing operation. The.retainer.424.includes a C-shaped.retaining ring.426.that is vertically separated from.base.422.and includes a.first opening.428.having a first width W.1., as well as a retaining.ring support.430.supporting C-shaped.retaining ring.426.on.base.422.on a side opposite opening.428.and defining a.second opening.432.that is intermediate.first opening.428.and.base.422.and that has a second width W.2.that is greater than first width W.1.. C-shaped.retaining ring.426.and retaining.ring support.430.in some embodiments may be integrally formed into a single bent or formed wire that includes a pair of.vertical portions.434.,.436.that define vertical supports that support the C-shaped.retaining ring.426.on.base.422...By providing a C-shaped retaining ring, additional lateral support may be provided for taller beverage containers, and moreover, given that shorter beverage containers may have less of a need for lateral support, providing a retaining ring support that has a larger effective opening width than the C-shaped retaining ring allows for wider, shorter beverage containers to be accommodated..FIG..18., for example, illustrates a short, wide beverage container, here a.mug.438., that is supported by.holder.420., but that does not extend all of the way to the elevation of C-shaped.retaining ring.426., while.FIG..19.illustrates a taller, narrow beverage container, here a.bottle.440., that extends through C-shaped.retaining ring.426.and is thus laterally supported by the C-shaped retaining ring..Returning to.FIG..17.,.base.422.in the illustrated embodiment may be formed of plastic, although other materials, e.g., various metal or wire configurations, may be used in other embodiments..Base.422.includes a plurality of (e.g., three) lip supports.442.that together operate as a substantially horizontal portion of the base to support the lip of a wide mouth beverage container, e.g.,.mug.438.as illustrated in.FIG..18.. Lip supports.442.additionally support a.central stabilizer ring.444.that operates as a substantially vertical portion of the base to support the shoulder of a narrow mount beverage container, e.g.,.bottle.440.as illustrated in.FIG..19...Additional potential holder designs are illustrated in.FIGS..20.-.23...FIG..20., for example, illustrates a.holder.450.including a base.452.having an inverted wedding cake design to capture various beverage containers of different mouth sizes..Base.452., in particular, has an.inclined portion.454.that defines a plurality of concentric annular supports capable of centering a beverage container in the holder. Moreover, in some embodiments, the.inclined portion.454.may include a plurality of.discrete steps.456...Base.452.may be molded plastic in some embodiments, and may be formed of a wire frame in other embodiments..FIG..21.illustrates a.holder.460.including a base.462.with a plurality of.base members.464.and a.retainer.466.with a plurality of.retainer members.468.configured to support the sidewall of a beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder in the inverted orientation. In this design,.base members.464.and.retainer members.468.are joined by mechanical linkages.470.(e.g., planar quadrilateral linkages) such that a weight of the beverage container when supported on the plurality of.base members.464.urges the plurality of.retainer members.468.toward the sidewall of the beverage container..FIG..22.illustrates a.similar holder.480.including a base.482.with a plurality of.base members.484.and a.retainer.486.with a plurality of.retainer members.488.defined on the ends of.base members.484.. Each.base member.484.includes a.pivot point.490., and depending upon the width of the lip of the beverage container relative to the pivot points.490., each.base member.484.will either rotate outwardly or inwardly. For wider beverage containers, e.g.,.mug.492., the lip is positioned radially outwardly from.pivot points.490., causing outward rotation of each.base member.484., with.retainer members.488.positioned away from the beverage container. For narrower beverage containers, however, the lip may be positioned radially inwardly from.pivot points.490., causing inward rotation of each.base member.484., such that the weight of the beverage container urges the.retainer members.488.against the sidewall of the beverage container..FIG..23.illustrates a.holder.500.including a base.502.similar to.base.422.of.holder.420.of.FIG..17., but with a.retainer.504.formed by a set of.vertical members.506.with spring-loaded.supports.508.that are normally biased inwardly and configured to deflect radially outwardly when a beverage container is inserted downwardly into the holder..Other holders may be used in other embodiments. Therefore, the invention is not limited to the particular holder designs illustrated herein..Pop-Up Sprayer.Now turning to.FIG..24., an example embodiment of.sprayer.38.of.spray assembly.30.is illustrated in greater detail. In the illustrated embodiment,.sprayer.38.is a pop-up sprayer that is capable of rotating about an axis of rotation, which in the illustrated embodiment is coincident with axis of rotation A about which inner.concentric housing member.62.rotates, as well as move between retracted and extended positions along the axis of rotation..Sprayer.38.includes a plurality of nozzles, e.g., seven.nozzles.520.,.522.,.524.,.526.,.528.,.530.and.532.in the illustrated embodiment, and as will become more apparent below, at least one of the nozzles (e.g., nozzle.520.) is an interior nozzle oriented to spray wash fluid into an interior of a beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder, and at least one of the nozzles (e.g., nozzle.530.) is a lip nozzle oriented to spray wash fluid onto an outer lip of the beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder..In the illustrated embodiment, and with additional reference to.FIG..25., nozzles.520.-.532.are supported by a manifold.534.including an.inlet.536.configured to receive a pressurized wash fluid, an.axial conduit.538.extending generally along the axis of rotation, and a pair of.transverse conduits.540.,.542.extending generally transverse to the axis of rotation, with each of.conduits.538.,.540.,.542.in fluid communication with.inlet.536...Nozzles.520.-.528.are referred to herein as interior nozzles and are supported by, and in fluid communication with.inlet.536.through,.axial conduit.538., and at least a subset of these interior nozzles is axially offset from.inlet.536.along the axis of rotation. While some of the wash fluid emitted by interior nozzles.520.-.528.may impact other regions of a beverage container (e.g.,.beverage container.544.of.FIG..25.), interior nozzles.520.-.528.are primarily configured to spray wash fluid into the.interior.546.of the beverage container, and as illustrated in.FIG..25., are generally arranged to provide overlapping spray patterns for different elevations within the interior of.beverage container.544.. The spray patterns may differ from one another along the axis of rotation, and the nozzles.520.-.528.may be axially and/or angularly offset from one another as shown in.FIGS..24.and.25...In the illustrated embodiment, for example,.interior nozzle.520.may be proximate a distal end of.axial conduit.538.from.inlet.536.and have a spray pattern with a center that is oriented along the axis of rotation..Interior nozzle.528.may be disposed proximate a junction between.axial conduit.538.and.transverse conduits.540.,.542., and may have a spray pattern that is oriented to spray wash fluid onto the inner lip of the beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder..Interior nozzles.522.,.524.and.526.may also be positioned proximate the distal end of.axial conduit.538., with.interior nozzles.524.and.526.angularly offset from one another by about 180 degrees and having spray patterns oriented to spray wash fluid onto the inner lip of the beverage container when the beverage container is held by the holder, and.interior nozzle.522.may have a spray pattern that is directed generally upwardly and overlaps the spray pattern of.interior nozzle.520...Nozzles.530.,.532.are referred to herein as lip nozzles and are supported by, and in fluid communication with.inlet.536.through,.transverse conduits.540.,.542., respectively. Each.nozzle.530.,.532.is radially offset from.inlet.536.relative to the axis of rotation, and while some of the wash fluid emitted by.lip nozzles.530.,.532.may impact other regions of a beverage container, each.lip nozzle.530.,.532.is primarily configured to spray wash fluid at least partially onto an.outer lip.548.of the.beverage container.544., i.e., a portion of the beverage container lip or opening formed by an.outer surface.550.of.beverage container.544.. As seen in.FIG..25., each.lip nozzle.530.,.532.may also focus spray onto other portions of the beverage container lip (e.g., an interior lip portion formed by an inner surface of the beverage container), and it will be appreciated that since it is generally the areas around the lip where a user's mouth may come into contact with the beverage container,.lip nozzles.530.,.532.in some embodiments may focus their efforts on spraying wash fluid at a sanitizing temperature to appropriately sanitize the areas of the beverage container that a user may likely come into contact with when drinking from the beverage container..In the illustrated embodiment,.transverse conduits.540.,.542.are angularly offset from one another by about 180 degrees and both extend substantially normal to the axis of rotation. In other embodiments, different numbers of transverse conduits, e.g., as few as one or more than two, may be used, and the transverse conduits may extend at differing angles relative to the axis of rotation, so the invention is not limited to the particular configuration illustrated herein..In addition, in the illustrated embodiment,.sprayer.38.may additionally include one or.more drive nozzles.552.that emit wash fluid in a tangential direction relative to the axis of rotation to drive rotation of.sprayer.38.when spraying wash fluid. In other embodiments, the wash fluid sprayed by another nozzle.520.-.532.may impart sufficient torque to rotate the sprayer, and.separate drive nozzles.552.may not be used. Further, in some embodiments an electric motor, pressurized air, or other electromechanical or mechanical drive system may be used to rotate the sprayer and/or move the sprayer between retracted and extended positions, whereby no.separate drive nozzles.552.may be used..Also in the illustrated embodiment, each nozzle.520.-.532.is a screw-in nozzle and is configured to threadably engage corresponding threaded apertures in.manifold.534.. As such, it may be desirable to form manifold.534.from a material capable of threadably engaging nozzles.520.-.532., e.g., metal. Each nozzle.520.-.532.also is configured with a fan spray pattern, e.g., with a spray width of about 15 to about 50 degrees in some embodiments. All nozzles.520.-.532.may be similarly configured in some embodiments, while in other embodiments, each nozzle.520.-.532.may include a different nozzle configuration tailored for its particular location and direction of spray. In the illustrated embodiment, the nozzles.520.-.532.are also clocked to a particular angle, e.g., such that the fan jets overlap and are all primarily oriented in the Y-plane. It will be appreciated that.sprayer.38.may utilize different numbers, locations, types and configurations of nozzles in other embodiments, so the invention is not limited to the specific arrangement of nozzles illustrated herein. For example, in some embodiments, nozzles may be integrally molded into a manifold, and in some embodiments, different spray patterns, e.g., fluidic nozzles, jet nozzles, etc., may be used..It will also be appreciated that, in the illustrated embodiment,.sprayer.38.is predominantly limited to spraying wash fluid onto the interior of a beverage container as well as the inner and outer lip thereof (e.g., about 1 inch of the outer surface of the beverage container proximate the lip). While other regions of the outside of the beverage container may come into contact with wash fluid in some instances, the focus of.sprayer.38.is on the areas of the beverage container that either come into contact with a beverage consumed by a user or come into contact with a user's mouth. Ultraviolet sanitizing.assembly.32.instead focuses on the outer surface of a beverage container, including the outer lip; however, it is believed that limiting.sprayer.38.to spraying the interior and outer lip of a beverage container with a wash fluid heated to a sanitizing temperature provides sufficient sanitization of a beverage container for many applications, and does so in a manner that reduces cycle time and water and energy consumption. In other embodiments, however, additional sprayers, e.g., located around the perimeter of the wash chamber, may be used to focus wash fluid onto the outside of a beverage container..With additional reference to.FIGS..26.-.27.,.manifold.534.is slidably received in a.base.554...Base.554.includes an.inlet.556.that receives pressurized wash fluid from.pump.138., and an.opening.558.that slidably and rotatably receives.manifold.534.. A.seal.560.is disposed on.base.554.to seal.opening.558., while still allowing for slidable and rotary movement of.manifold.534.. A.bias mechanism.562., e.g., a spring, is used to bias manifold.534., and thus sprayer.38., to a retracted position, e.g., as illustrated in.FIGS..24.-.26.. However,.manifold.534.is configured to overcome.bias mechanism.562.and slide within.base.554.to an extended position, e.g., as illustrated in.FIG..27., as a result of the pressure generated by wash fluid received through.inlet.556.of.base.554...As illustrated in.FIG..26., when.sprayer.38.is in the retracted position,.axial conduit.538.of.manifold.534.is generally at an elevation where the likelihood of contact between.beverage container.368.and.sprayer.38.during insertion or removal of the beverage container into or from.holder.28.is minimized. However, as illustrated in.FIG..27., when.sprayer.38.extends to the extended position due to the pressurization of.manifold.534.when supplied with pressurized wash fluid by.pump.138.,.axial conduit.538.of.manifold.534.projects into the interior of.beverage container.538.to position nozzles.520.-.526.within the interior, and nozzles.528.-.532.are positioned to focus spray onto the lip of the beverage container. When fluid flow to sprayer.38.from.pump.138.is discontinued, the bias mechanism then urges the sprayer back to the retracted position..Seal.560.in some embodiments may be a seal collar with living hinge, and a.screw cap.564.may be used in some embodiments to secure.manifold.534.within.base.554.. It will be appreciated that, given the high pressure utilized in some embodiments, other sealing arrangements may be used to minimize fluid and pressure loss through.opening.558.. In addition, while.bias mechanism.562.is configured as a spring in the illustrated embodiment, other manners of biasing the sprayer to the retracted position may be used in other embodiments, e.g., a gravity bias mechanism that allows the manifold to drop to the retracted position based upon the weight of the manifold.534.and nozzles.520.-.532.. Further, as noted above, in some embodiments an electric motor, solenoid, pressurized air, or other electromechanical or mechanical drive system may be used in some embodiments to transition.sprayer.38.between the extended and retracted positions. Therefore, the invention is not limited to the particular sprayer design illustrated herein..Beverage Container Washing System with Multiple Openings.With reference to.FIGS..28.and.29., another beverage.container washing system.600.consistent with the invention includes.concentric housing members.602.and outer.concentric housing member.604.configured as concentric domes that are generally dome shaped and have generally cylindrical sidewalls, with inner.concentric housing member.602.is rotatable and driven by a drive motor (not shown) coupled to a.gear.606.that drives a.ring gear.608.attached to inner.concentric housing member.602.. Outer.concentric housing member.604.is fixed or stationary. In this embodiment, inner.concentric housing member.602.includes multiple openings, e.g., first and.second openings.610.,.612., while outer.concentric housing member.604.includes first and.second openings.614.,.616.(e.g., entrance and exit openings, respectively), with each pair of openings disposed on substantially opposite sides from one another (e.g., about 180 degrees angularly offset from one another)..When inner.concentric housing member.602.is rotated to the orientation illustrated in.FIG..28., it will be appreciated that.openings.610.and.614.are aligned, as are.openings.616.. By doing so, access to a.wash chamber.618.is provided, enabling for insertion and/or removal of a.beverage container.610.into and/or out of a.holder.622.through either aligned.openings.610.,.614.on.side.624.of beverage.container washing system.600.or aligned.openings.612.,.616.on.side.626.of.washing system.600.. A rotation of inner.concentric housing member.604.of about a quarter turn (about 90 degrees) in either direction results in the configuration illustrated in.FIG..29., where it may be seen that.openings.610.,.612.of inner.concentric housing member.602.are now facing the sidewall of outer.concentric housing member.604., and are unaligned with.openings.614.,.616.. By doing so, wash.chamber.618.is effectively closed off for a washing operation, and the sidewall of inner.concentric housing member.602.minimizes the escape of wash fluid through.openings.614.,.616...In this configuration, the orientation illustrated in.FIG..28.may be considered to function both as a loading position and an unloading position, with the orientation illustrated in.FIG..29.functioning as a washing position. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that an orientation where inner.concentric housing member.602.is rotated 180 degrees relative to that illustrated in.FIG..28., where.openings.610.,.612.of inner.concentric housing member.602.are aligned with.openings.616.,.614.of outer.concentric housing member.604., respectively, may also be considered to represent loading and/or unloading positions. In addition, an orientation where inner.concentric housing member.602.is rotated 180 degrees relative to that illustrated in.FIG..29.may also be considered to be a washing position. Moreover, transitioning between loading, washing and unloading positions may occur in different manners in different embodiments. In one embodiment, for example, a 90 degree rotation in one direction may transition from a loading position to a washing position, followed by another 90 degree rotation in the same direction to transition from the washing position to the unloading position. In another embodiment, a 90 degree rotation in one direction may transition from a loading position to a washing position, followed by a 90 degree rotation in the opposite direction to transition from the washing position to the unloading position. Further, it will be appreciated that with the use of two openings in the inner concentric housing member, no transition may be required between the unloading and loading positions at the completion of a washing operation, since the same relative positions may be used for both unloading and loading (although in other embodiments, a 180 degree rotation may be used if desired to transition between unloading and loading positions). Thus, while reference is made herein to separate loading and unloading positions, it will be appreciated that such positions may be represented by the same relative positions between the inner and outer.concentric housing members.602.,.604.in some embodiments..Beverage.container washing system.600.also illustrates an alternative.ultraviolet sanitizing assembly.628.and.dryer assembly.630.that may be suitable for use in some embodiments..Ultraviolet sanitizing assembly.628.in this embodiment includes a first pair of.ultraviolet lights.632.,.634.that are mounted to inner.concentric housing member.602.in a similar manner to.ultraviolet lights.40.as described above, with each positioned on opposite sides.intermediate openings.610.,.612., as well as a second pair of.ultraviolet lights.636.,.638.that are mounted to outer.concentric housing member.604.and positioned on opposite sides.intermediate openings.614.,.616.. In this configuration, and as seen in.FIG..29., when in a washing position,.ultraviolet lights.632.,.634.,.636.and.638.are relatively evenly spaced about the periphery of.wash chamber.618., thus providing substantially 360 degree exposure to the outside of.beverage container.620.. Moreover,.ultraviolet lights.636.and.638.are respectively aligned with.openings.610.,.612.of inner.concentric housing member.602.such that the sidewall of inner.concentric housing member.602.does not block the ultraviolet radiation emitted by.ultraviolet lights.636.,.638...Dryer assembly.630.in this embodiment includes a pair of.stationary air knives.640.,.642.that are supplied by a blower and, as illustrated in.FIG..29., are aligned with.openings.610.,.612.of inner.concentric housing member.602.such that the sidewall of inner.concentric housing member.602.does not block airflow from the.air knives.640.,.642.. It will be appreciated that in some embodiments,.air knives.640.,.642.may be used instead of the top-down configuration illustrated in.FIGS..11.-.12., while in other embodiments,.air knives.640.,.642.may be used in addition to the aforementioned top-down configuration of.FIGS..11.-.12...Other modifications may be made to the illustrated embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, the invention lies in the claims hereinafter appended."
