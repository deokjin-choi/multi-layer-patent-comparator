As one non-limiting example, a person may wear an electronic watch that has two external electrodes configured to be touched by the user. A first electrode may be placed on a rear surface of the watch and be in contact with skin on the wrist of the person. A second electrode may be defined by or on a crown of the watch and may be configured to be touched by a finger (or other body part) of the person..FIG. 1A.shows a functional block diagram of a wearable.electronic device.100.. In some examples, the.device.100.may be an electronic watch or electronic health monitoring device. The wearable.electronic device.100.may include one or.more input devices.102., one or.more output devices.104., and a.processor.106.. Broadly, the.input devices.102.may detect various types of input, and the.output devices.104.may provide various types of output. The.processor.106.may receive input signals from the.input devices.102., in response to inputs detected by the input devices. The.processor.106.may interpret input signals received from one or more of the.input devices.102.and transmit output signals to one or more of the.output devices.104.. The output signals may cause the.output devices.104.to provide one or more outputs. Detected input at one or more of the.input devices.102.may be used to control one or more functions of the.device.100.. In some cases, one or more of the.output devices.104.may be configured to provide outputs that are dependent on, or manipulated in response to, the input detected by one or more of the.input devices.102.. The outputs provided by one or more of the.output devices.104.may also be responsive to, or initiated by, a program or application executed by the.processor.106.and/or an associated companion device..In various embodiments, the.input devices.102.may include any suitable components for detecting inputs. Examples of.input devices.102.include audio sensors (e.g., microphones), optical or visual sensors (e.g., cameras, visible light sensors, or invisible light sensors), proximity sensors, touch sensors, force sensors, mechanical devices (e.g., crowns, switches, buttons, or keys), vibration sensors, orientation sensors, motion sensors (e.g., accelerometers or velocity sensors), location sensors (e.g., global positioning system (GPS) devices), thermal sensors, communication devices (e.g., wired or wireless communication devices), resistive sensors, magnetic sensors, electroactive polymers (EAPs), strain gauges, electrodes, and so on, or some combination thereof. Each.input device.102.may be configured to detect one or more particular types of input and provide a signal (e.g., an input signal) corresponding to the detected input. The signal may be provided, for example, to the.processor.106...The.output devices.104.may include any suitable components for providing outputs. Examples of.output devices.104.include audio output devices (e.g., speakers), visual output devices (e.g., lights or displays), tactile output devices (e.g., haptic output devices), communication devices (e.g., wired or wireless communication devices), and so on, or some combination thereof. Each.output device.104.may be configured to receive one or more signals (e.g., an output signal provided by the processor.106.) and provide an output corresponding to the signal..The.processor.106.may be operably coupled to the.input devices.102.and the.output devices.104.. The.processor.106.may be adapted to exchange signals with the.input devices.102.and the.output devices.104.. For example, the.processor.106.may receive an input signal from an.input device.102.that corresponds to an input detected by the.input device.102.. The.processor.106.may interpret the received input signal to determine whether to provide and/or change one or more outputs in response to the input signal. The.processor.106.may then send an output signal to one or more of the.output devices.104., to provide and/or change outputs as appropriate. Examples of suitable processors are discussed in more detail below with respect to.FIG. 25...In some examples, the.input devices.102.may include a set of electrodes. The electrodes may be disposed on one or more exterior surfaces of the.device.100.. The.processor.106.may monitor for voltages or signals received on at least one of the electrodes. In some embodiments, one of the electrodes may be permanently or switchably coupled to a device ground. The electrodes may be used to provide an ECG function for the.device.100.. For example, a 2-lead ECG function may be provided when a user of the.device.100.contacts first and second electrodes that receive signals from the user. As another example, a 3-lead ECG function may be provided when a user of the.device.100.contacts first and second electrodes that receive signals from the user, and a third electrode that grounds the user to the.device.100.. In both the 2-lead and 3-lead ECG embodiments, the user may press the first electrode against a first part of their body and press the second electrode against a second part of their body. The third electrode may be pressed against the first or second body part, depending on where it is located on the.device.100...FIG. 1B.shows an example of an electronic device.110.(here, an electronic watch) having a set of.electrodes.112.,.114.disposed thereon. The.device.110.may be an example of the wearable electronic device described with reference to.FIG. 1A., or may be an example of an electronic device that is not wearable. In some embodiments, the set of.electrodes.112.,.114.may be provided on one surface of the.device.110.. In other embodiments (as shown), the set of.electrodes.112.,.114.may include electrodes provided on different surfaces of the.device.100., such as a.first electrode.112.provided on a.first surface.116.of the.device.110., and a.second electrode.114.provided on a.second surface.118.of the.device.110.. Providing electrodes on different surfaces of a device may make it easier for a user to place different body parts in contact with different electrodes. For example, a user may place one or more of the electrodes (e.g., the first electrode.112.) in contact with their wrist, and may touch another one or more of the electrodes (e.g., the second electrode.114.) with a finger of their opposite hand. Alternatively, the user may press the.electrodes.112.,.114.against different parts of their body. A.processor.120.of the.device.110., or a processor remote from the.device.110., may determine, from the voltages or signals (e.g., from stored digital samples or values representing the voltages or signals), the biological parameter(s) of the user. The biological parameter(s) may include, for example, an electrocardiogram (ECG) of the user, an indication of whether the user is experiencing atrial fibrillation, an indication of whether the user is experiencing premature atrial contraction or premature ventricular contraction, an indication of whether the user is experiencing a sinus arrhythmia, and so on..In some embodiments, one or two thin film electrodes may be PVD deposited on an exterior surface of a structure that forms part of a housing of an electronic device. The surface may be any transparent, semi-transparent, translucent, or opaque surface made out of an amorphous solid, glass, a crystal or crystalline material (such as sapphire or zirconia), plastic, or the like. In the case of a watch (i.e., a type of electronic device), an additional electrode may be positioned on a user-rotatable crown of a watch body, on a button of the watch body, or on another surface of a housing that defines the watch body..When an electrode is formed on a carrier that forms part of a housing of an electronic device, the electrode may be connected to an electrical contact within the electronic device by depositing the electrode material such that it wraps around an edge or perimeter of the carrier, and onto an interior surface of the carrier. The electrical contact may be on the interior surface of the carrier. In other embodiments, the electrode may be formed on the exterior surface of the carrier, and a thru-carrier via that is filled or coated with a conductive material may connect the electrode to an electrical contact within the electronic device. The carrier may be any appropriate structure that supports the electrodes, on which the electrodes are formed, or to which the electrodes are attached. In certain embodiments described herein, the carrier is an optically transparent material having a dome shape. It should be appreciated that the carrier may have different shapes (flat, stepped, parallelepiped, and so on) and may be made from different materials, including opaque materials..Generally, the term attached means that two elements, objects, structures, or objects are separate but affixed or retained to one another, whether removably, as with an electronic device attached to a user by a band, or fixedly, as with two elements that are affixed to one another with a mechanical fastener not meant to be decoupled (a screw, bolt, or the like), by an adhesive, by plating or depositing one material on another (as with an electrode deposited on the carrier), and so on. The term connected means that two elements may be attached to one another, or may be two parts of a unitary whole (as with a shaft and crown body formed from the same material as a single piece). Thus, while two elements that are attached to one another are necessarily connected to one another, the reverse is not necessarily true. For example, two elements may be formed as a single piece or part and thus connected to one another, although they are not attached to one another..When an electrode is provided on a crown of an electronic device, the crown may be conductive or have a conductive surface, and the conductive portion of the crown may be coupled to a conductive rotatable shaft that extends through an opening in a device housing. An end of the shaft interior to the housing, or a conductive shaft retainer interior to the housing, may be in mechanical and electrical contact with a spring-biased conductor that carries electrical signals between the shaft or shaft retainer and a circuit, thereby providing electrical communication between the crown and the circuit..A processor of an electronic device (e.g., the processor.120.) may be operable to determine a biological parameter of a user based on voltages at various electrodes (e.g., at the set of.electrodes.112.,.114.). In some cases, the biological parameter may be an ECG of a user of the electronic device. For example, when a watch has a first electrode on an exterior surface of a carrier and a second electrode on a crown, the user's fastening of the watch to their wrist may place the first electrode in contact with skin on the user's wrist. To acquire an ECG, the user may touch a conductive portion of the crown with a finger on their opposite hand. For example, the carrier or housing of the watch may touch a wrist adjacent one hand, and the crown may be touched with a finger of the opposite hand. In some cases, the watch may have a third electrode, also on the exterior surface of the carrier, which grounds the user to the watch. The third electrode may be used to reject noise from ECG signals. The electrodes may be positioned on different surfaces, or different portions of surfaces, in various embodiments..The electrode(s) on the exterior surface of the carrier may be positioned at the periphery of the carrier, or otherwise positioned to enable an optical sensor subsystem to emit and receive light through the carrier. The light may be emitted into, and reflected from, a user's skin to determine other biological parameters of the user, such as a heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, blood oxygenation, glucose level, and so on..These and other embodiments are discussed with reference to.FIGS. 1-25.. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes only and should not be construed as limiting..FIGS. 2A-2C.show an example of an.electronic watch.200.that incorporates a set of electrodes. The.watch.200.may be an example of the wearable.electronic device.100.or.110.described with reference to.FIG. 1A or 1B.. The.watch.200.may include a.watch body.202.and a.watch band.204.. The.watch body.202.may include an input or selection device, such as a.crown.210.or a.button.212...FIG. 2A.shows an isometric view of the watch body's front face..FIG. 2B.shows an example cross-section of the.crown.210...FIG. 2C.shows an isometric view of the watch body's rear face. In.FIGS. 2A  2C., only a portion of the.watch band.204.is shown (i.e., only the portions of the.watch band.204.that attach to the watch body.202.)..The.watch body.202.may include a.housing.206.. The.housing.206.may include a front.side housing member.206.a.that faces away from a user's skin when the.watch.200.is worn by a user (see.FIG. 2A.), and a back.side housing member.206.b.(or rear cover) that faces toward the user's skin (see.FIG. 2C.). Alternatively, the.housing.206.may include a singular housing member, or more than two housing members. The one or more housing members may be metallic, plastic, ceramic, crystal, or other types of housing members (or may include combinations of such materials)..As shown in.FIG. 2A., a.transparent cover.208.may be attached to a front side of the watch body.202.(i.e., facing away from a user's skin), over or within an opening in the.housing.206., and may protect a display positioned at least partially within the.housing.206.. The display may be viewable by a user through the.cover.208.. In some embodiments, the display may depict an ECG waveform of a person who is wearing or otherwise using the.watch.200.. In some cases, the.cover.208.may be part of a display stack, which display stack may include a touch sensing or force sensing capability. The display may be configured to depict a graphical output of the.watch.200., and a user may interact with the graphical output (e.g., using a finger or stylus that touches or hovers over the.cover.208., or using the.crown.210.or button.212.). As one example, the user may select (or otherwise interact with) a graphic, icon, indicator, message, or the like (collectively, graphic) presented on the display by touching or pressing on the display at the location of the graphic. In some embodiments, the user may receive confirmation of their selection by means of haptic output provided by the.watch body.202.through the display or.cover.208.. The exterior surface of the.cover.208.may therefore function as a means for receiving input (i.e., function as an input device) and a means for providing output (i.e., function as an output device). The.cover.208.may be attached to the.housing.206.or part of the housing.206.(e.g., connected to the housing). In some embodiments, the.cover.208.may be considered part of the.housing.206.because it forms part of an outer shell that defines an interior volume (or houses internal components) of the.watch body.202.. In some examples, the.cover.208.may be or include a crystal, such as a sapphire crystal. Alternatively, the.cover.208.may be formed of glass, plastic, or other materials..The.watch body.202.may include at least one input device or selection device, such as a.crown.210., scroll wheel, knob, dial,.button.212., or the like, which input device may be operated by a user of the.watch.200.. In some embodiments, the.crown.210., scroll wheel, knob, dial,.button.212., or the like may be conductive, or have a conductive surface, and a signal route may be provided between the conductive portion of the.crown.210., scroll wheel, knob, dial,.button.212., or the like and a circuit (including a processor) within the.watch body.202...The operation of determining and/or displaying a user's ECG may be initiated by rotating the.crown.210., translating the crown, tilting the crown, touching the crown, and so on. Likewise the operation of determining the ECG may be initiated by interacting with a touch-.sensitive cover.208.or display of the electronic watch. As discussed above, the display may be partially or fully within the housing of the electronic watch..Turning primarily to.FIG. 2B., it is shown that the.housing.206.may include an opening through which a.shaft.224.extends. A.crown.210.may be connected to the.shaft.224., and may be accessible to a user exterior to the.housing.206.. The.crown.210.may be manipulated by a user to rotate or translate the shaft, as indicated by.arrows.218.and.220.. Such manipulations are examples of crown inputs. The shaft may be mechanically, electrically, magnetically, and/or optically coupled to components within the.housing.206.. In some embodiments, the.crown.210.may be part of a crown assembly, as described with reference to.FIG. 11, 12A, 12B, 13., or.14...A user's manipulation of the crown.210.(and thus the shaft.224.) may be used to manipulate or select various textual or graphical elements displayed by the.watch.200., to adjust a volume of a speaker, to turn the.watch.200.on or off, and so on. In some embodiments, the.crown.210.may be manipulated (e.g., rotated or pressed) to select or activate a health monitoring function of the watch.200.(e.g., an ECG or other heart monitoring function). For example, a user may rotate the crown to select an ECG application, and may press the crown to activate the ECG application (e.g., initiate determination and display of a wearer's ECG). Alternatively, a user's touch or press of the crown (or touch or press of the crown for a predetermined period of time) may activate the ECG application and cause a heart rhythm of the user to be displayed. As yet another example, the user may interact with the touch-sensitive display to select and/or activate the ECG application. By way of example, a user's activation of an ECG application is indicated by the watch's display of the.ECG.222.in.FIG. 2A.. Alternatively, the user's selection of an ECG application may be indicated by another graphic or text displayed by the.watch.200.. Generally, the watch.200.(and specifically its display) may change from displaying some graphic or text to displaying the.ECG.222.once the ECG (or its corresponding application, or function) is initiated, selected, or determined..As shown in.FIG. 2B., the.crown.210.may be connected to the shaft.224.(and may be unitary with the shaft), and the.shaft.224.may extend through an opening in the.housing.206.. In some embodiments, the.shaft.224.may be separated from the.housing.206.by a bushing or other component, or retained to the.housing.206.by a retention mechanism. The.shaft.224.may rotate or translate with respect to the.housing.206., as indicated by.arrows.218.and.220., thereby providing one or more crown inputs to a processor of the.electronic device.200.. A.first sensor.226.within the.housing.206.may sense aspects of shaft movement such as direction of rotation, speed of rotation, rotational acceleration, or angular position of the.shaft.224.. In some embodiments, the.first sensor.226.may be an optical sensor positioned adjacent the.shaft.224., such that.light.227.is emitted onto, and reflected from, the.shaft.224...Light.227.may be reflected from the shaft by a pattern of surface features (such as scallops, grooves, indentation, projections, or the like) or by byproducts of machining the shaft, such as bumps, scratches, irregularities, and so on. The pattern and speed of.light.227.reflected onto the.optical sensor.226.maybe used to determine a direction and/or speed of rotation of the.shaft.224.. In other embodiments, different sensors may be used to detection direction and/or speed of rotation of the.shaft.224., including mechanical sensors, electrical sensors, capacitive sensors, brush contacts, magnetic sensors, and so on..A.second sensor.228.within the.housing.206.may sense aspects of shaft movement such as translation or direction of translation. In some embodiments, the.second sensor.228.may be a tactile switch, optical sensor, magnetic sensor, capacitive sensor or the like positioned at an end of the.shaft.224...A.third sensor.230.within the.housing.206.may sense when a user is touching the.crown.210., or may sense signals (e.g., a heart rhythm) received by the.crown.210.when a user touches the.crown.210.. In some embodiments, the.third sensor.230.may be electrically coupled to the.crown.210.or.shaft.224.. In some cases, the.sensors.226.,.228.,.230.may be provide signals or information to the.processor.214., or may be partly or wholly integrated with the.processor.214.or other components of the.watch.200.. In some embodiments, two or more of the.sensors.226.,.228.,.230.may be combined into a multipurpose sensor. In some embodiments, one or more of the.sensors.226.,.228.,.230.may not be provided. In some embodiments, the functions of one of the.sensors.226.,.228.,.230.may be distributed among multiple sensors, or additional crown sensors may be provided..Any or all of the.first sensor.226.,.second sensor.228., and.third sensor.230.may be attached to or otherwise supported by one or more.internal supports.232., as shown in.FIG. 2B...Turning primarily to.FIG. 2C., the.housing.206.may include structures for attaching the.watch band.204.to the.watch body.202.. In some cases, the structures may include elongate recesses or openings through which ends of the.watch band.204.may be inserted and attached to the.watch body.202.. In other cases (not shown), the structures may include indents (e.g., dimples or depressions) in the.housing.206., which indents may receive ends of spring pins that are attached to or threaded through ends of a watch band to attach the watch band to the.watch body.202...The.watch band.204.may be used to secure the.watch.200.to a user, another device, a retaining mechanism, and so on..As previously mentioned, the.watch.200.may include a set of electrodes. The set of electrodes may be configured, in some cases, as described with reference to.FIG. 1A or 1B.. The set of electrodes may be used by a.processor.214.that is internal to the.watch body.202., to sense biological parameters (e.g., an ECG) of a person who wears the.watch.200.and presses the electrodes against their skin. In some embodiments, the set of electrodes may include a rear-facing.electrode.216.on the back of the watch body.202.(e.g., on the back.side housing member.206.b.). The set of electrodes may also include an electrode on the.crown.210.and/or an electrode on the.button.212...The rear-facing.electrode.216.may be formed (e.g., printed, plated, or otherwise deposited) on the back.side housing member.206.b.. If the back.side housing member.206.b.is non-conductive, the rear-facing.electrode.216.may be formed directly on the back.side housing member.206.b.and connected to circuitry internal to the watch body.202.(e.g., the processor.214.) by, for example, conductive vias formed through the back.side housing member.206.b.. If the back.side housing member.206.b.is conductive, the rear-facing.electrode.216.may be separated from the back.side housing member.206.b.by an insulator or insulating layer, and conductive vias formed through the back.side housing member.206.b.may likewise be insulated from the back.side housing member.206.b.. Alternatively, the back.side housing member.206.b.may have an opening to which the rear-facing.electrode.216.is mated. In some embodiments, the opening may define a ledge in the back.side housing member.206.b., and the rear-facing.electrode.216.may rest on the ledge (and in some cases may be separated from the back.side housing member.206.b.by an insulator (e.g., a seal) or an insulating layer)..The electrode(s) on the.crown.210.or.button.212.may be conductive surfaces of the.crown.210.or.button.212.. In some cases, the.crown.210.or.button.212.may be conductive over its entire exterior surface. In other cases, the.crown.210.or.button.212.may have conductive portions (e.g., cores or inserts). When the front.side housing member.206.a.is conductive, the.crown.210.or button.212.(or the conductive components thereof) may be insulated from the front.side housing member.206.a.by an insulator (e.g., a set of seals, non-conductive coatings, and so on)..In some embodiments, one of the.crown.210.or.button.212.may have an electrode thereon, and a user wearing the.watch.200.on one of their wrists may touch the electrode on the.crown.210.or.button.212.with a finger of their opposite hand. The.processor.214.may then use the electrodes to acquire an ECG for the user. In other embodiments, both the.crown.210.and the.button.212.may have an electrode thereon, and a user wearing the.watch.200.on one of their wrists may touch the electrodes on the.crown.210.and.button.212.with a finger of their opposite hand. In still other embodiments, the entirety of the back.side housing member.206.b.(or even the entirety of the housing.206.) may be an electrode. In these latter embodiments, electrical isolation may be provided between the.housing.206.and the.crown.210.and/or between the.housing.206.and the.button.212...In some examples, the.watch.200.may lack the display, the.crown.210., or the.button.212.. For example, the.watch.200.may include an audio input or output interface, a touch input interface, a haptic (force) input or output interface, or other input or output interface that does not require the display,.crown.210., or.button.212.. The.watch.200.may also include the afore-mentioned input or output interfaces in addition to the display,.crown.210., or.button.212.. When the.watch.200.lacks the display, the front face of the.watch.200.may be covered by the.cover.208., or by a metallic or other type of housing member (e.g., the opening for the.cover.208.may not exist, and the front.side housing member.206.a.may extend over the area defined by the cover.208.). In these embodiments, the electrode(s) on the.crown.210.or.button.212.may be replaced by (or supplemented with) an electrode on the front face of the.watch body.202.. A user may touch the front-facing electrode with a finger, similarly to how they would touch an electrode on the.crown.210.and/or.button.212.. Alternatively, a user could place the front-facing electrode in contact with, for example, an opposite wrist, part of their leg, or their torso or forehead..In some embodiments, the.watch.200.may lack the rear-facing.electrode.216., and each of the.crown.210.and the.button.212.may have a conductive surface that serves as an electrode. In these embodiments, the.watch.200.may need to be removed from a user's wrist to enable the user to press different parts of their body against the crown and button electrodes. In some embodiments, the.crown.210.or the.button.212.may be moved to an opposite side of the.watch body.202., thereby increasing the separation between the.crown.210.and the.button.212.and making it easier for a user to press different parts of their body against the crown and button electrodes..Other electronic devices that may incorporate a set of electrodes include other wearable electronic devices, other timekeeping devices, other health monitoring or fitness devices, other portable computing devices, mobile phones (including smart phones), tablet computing devices, digital media players, or the like..Because the voltages or signals provided at, propagated from, or monitored at the various electrodes of a set electrodes may be low voltage or have low amplitudes, the materials, positions, electrical connections to, and electrical routing paths for the set of electrodes can have a significant impact on a processor's ability to discern useful signals representing an ECG or other biological parameter of a person wearing the.watch.200.or a similar device (e.g., one of the other watches or electronic devices described herein). The materials, positions, electrical connections to, and electrical routing paths for the set of electrodes can determine how well the electrodes receive voltages/signals from the person's skin (e.g., a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a device-to-user interface through which the voltages/signals pass); how well voltages/signals are transferred between the electrodes and internal components of the watch.200.(e.g., a voltage/signal propagation SNR); and how well the electrodes operate in the face of environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, moisture, electromagnetic radiation, dust, and so on. Techniques described in the present disclosure may improve the usability of a set of electrodes under some or all of these conditions..FIG. 3.shows another example of an.electronic watch.300.that incorporates a set of electrodes. The.watch.300.may be an example of the wearable.electronic device.100.or.110.described with reference to.FIG. 1 or 1B., and may include many of the components of the.watch.200.described with reference to.FIGS. 2A-2C.. The.watch.300.may include a.watch body.202.and a.watch band.204...FIG. 3.shows an isometric view of the watch body's rear face. Only a portion of the.watch band.204.is shown (i.e., only the portions of the.watch band.204.that attach to the watch body.202.)..The.watch.300.in.FIG. 3.differs from the.watch.200.of prior figures in that it has a different set of internal components, a different back.side housing member.302., and a different set of elements that are provided or exposed on the back.side housing member.302.. For example, the.watch.300.may include a sensor subsystem that includes both electrical and optical components. The electrical components may include one or.more electrodes.304.,.306.formed on the back.side housing member.302.. In some cases, each of the.electrodes.304.,.306.may have a circular shape and may be PVD deposited on the back.side housing member.302.. Alternatively, only one, or more than two electrodes may be formed on the back.side housing member.302., or the.electrodes.304.,.306.may be positioned over (or inset into) openings in the back.side housing member.302...The optical components of the sensor system may include a set of one or.more windows.308.,.310.,.312.,.314.in the back.side housing member.302.. Each of the.windows.308.,.310.,.312.,.314.may pass at least one wavelength of light. In some cases, each of the.windows.308.,.310.,.312.,.314.may have a semicircular shape. The windows may alternatively have other shapes. The windows may be formed of crystal, glass, plastic or another material that passes at least one wavelength of light emitted or received by the sensor subsystem..In some embodiments, the back.side housing member.302.may be or include a transparent cover (e.g., a cover including a crystal, such as a sapphire crystal, or glass, or plastic, or the like), and may be substantially flat or planar (as shown) or may be curved or otherwise non-planar. A mask (e.g., an ink mask and/or dark mask) may be applied to the transparent cover to define the.windows.308.,.310.,.312.,.314.. The.electrodes.304.,.306.may be formed on top of the mask or over openings in the mask..In some embodiments, the back.side housing member.302.may be an opaque substrate, such as a metal or plastic substrate, and one or more.transparent windows.308.,.310.,.312.,.314.may be fitted to openings in the substrate. The transparent windows may be fitted to the openings internally to (or externally from) the.watch body.202.. The.electrodes.304.,.306.may be fitted to additional openings that enable the.electrodes.304.,.306.to protrude outward from the external surface of the back.side housing member.302., or the.electrodes.304.,.306.may be formed on the surface of the back.side housing member.302.and the electrically connected to components internal to the.watch body.202.by conductive vias or other elements formed through the surface of the back.side housing member.302...By way of example,.FIG. 3.shows the.electrodes.304.,.306.aligned along a first axis that divides the back.side housing member.302.into two halves, and shows the.windows.308.,.310.,.312.,.314.aligned along a second axis, perpendicular to the first axis, that divides the back.side housing member.302.into a different two halves. In this manner, the.electrodes.304.,.306.and.windows.308.,.310.,.312.,.314.may form four circular areas on the exterior surface of the back.side housing member.302., with the circular areas that contain the.windows.308.,.310.,.312.,.314.appearing bifurcated..In use, each pair of.windows.308./.310.,.312./.314.forming a circular area may include a first window under which one or more light emitters are positioned, and a second window under which one or more light receivers are positioned, with an optional set of one or more light blocking walls positioned between the one or more light emitters and the one or more light receivers (or around the light emitter(s), or around the light receiver(s))..FIGS. 4A-4D.show an additional example of an.electronic watch.400.that incorporates a set of electrodes. The.watch.400.may be an example of the wearable.electronic device.100.or.110.described with reference to.FIG. 1A or 1B., and may include many of the components of the.watch.200.described with reference to.FIGS. 2A-2C.. The.watch.400.may include a.watch body.202.and a.watch band.204...FIG. 4A.shows an isometric view of the watch body's rear face. Only a portion of the.watch band.204.is shown (i.e., only the portions of the.watch band.204.that attach to the watch body.202.)..Similarly to the.watch.300.described with reference to.FIG. 3., the.watch.400.may include a sensor subsystem that includes both electrical and optical components. However, the electrical and optical components of the.watch.400.may be arranged differently than the electrical and optical components of the.watch.300...Referring primarily to.FIG. 4A., a light-transmissive element such as a carrier.404.(e.g., a rear-facing or skin-facing carrier) may be coupled to or otherwise attached to a back.side housing member.402.of the.watch.400., and in some cases may be considered to form a part of the.housing.206.of the.watch body.202.. The.carrier.404.may have a.first surface.406.that is interior to the watch body.202.(see.FIG. 4C.) and a.second surface.408.that is exterior to the watch body.202.(see.FIG. 4A.). The.carrier.404.may be dome-shaped or otherwise non-planar, as shown in.FIGS. 4A-4C., such that the.second surface.408.protrudes or extends away from a.back member.402.of the.watch.400.. This is best illustrated in.FIGS. 4B and 4C...By way of example, the.carrier.404.is shown as having a round perimeter and fitted to a round opening in the back.side housing member.402.. In other examples, the.carrier.404.may have a perimeter that is square, oval, or some other shape. Similarly, the opening in the back.side housing member.402.may be square, oval, or some other shape. The perimeter of the.carrier.204.and the perimeter of the opening need not have the same size or shape (e.g., the perimeter of the opening in the back.side housing member.402.may be smaller or differently shaped than the perimeter of the carrier.404.). In some examples, the.carrier.404.may be a sapphire crystal. Alternatively, the.carrier.404.may be formed from (or replaced by) a light-transmissive element formed of glass, plastic, or another material. The.carrier.404.may be transparent to all wavelengths of light or just some wavelengths (and even one wavelength) of light..The.exterior surface.408.of the.carrier.404.may have a set of electrodes (e.g., first and second (or rear-facing).electrodes.412.,.414.) thereon, although in some embodiments a single electrode or more than two electrodes may be used. In some embodiments, the.electrodes.412.,.414.may be PVD deposited on the.carrier.404.. Example constructions of the.electrodes.412.,.414.and.masks.422.are described with reference to.FIGS. 5A-5E, 6-8, 9A-9C., .10.A-.10.D. In some embodiments, the.electrodes.412.,.414.may be opaque. In other examples, the.electrodes.412.,.414.may be formed of a transparent material, as described with reference to.FIG. 6., and the.optical sensor subsystem.416.may transmit/receive light through the.electrodes.412.,.414.. The.optical sensor subsystem.416.may be, for example, an optical heart rate sensor..In some cases, the first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.may be arc-shaped (e.g., semi-circle-shaped), and may be positioned around a.central opening.418.and concentric ring of.openings.420.formed in the.masks.422.. The first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.may extend to the edge of the.carrier.404., and in some cases may wrap around the perimeter of the.carrier.404.to the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404., or be connected to conductive vias formed in the.carrier.404., or otherwise be electrically connected to elements within the.watch body.202.that receive a signal sensed by one or both of the first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.. In some cases, the first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.may be electrically insulated from the back side housing member.402.(e.g., by a non-conductive gasket or adhesive), or the back.side housing member.402.may be non-conductive. In some cases, the first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.may be formed of, or include, stainless steel (SUS) or diamond like carbon (DLC)..The.electrodes.412.,.414.may be positioned (e.g., at the periphery of the.carrier.404.or in other locations) so as not to interfere with optical communication between an.optical sensor subsystem.416.interior to the watch body.202.(see.FIG. 4C.) and a medium (e.g., skin) exterior to the.watch body.202.. The optical communication may occur through the.carrier.404., and in some cases may occur through a number of.openings.418.,.420.formed in one or.more masks.422.applied to the.carrier.404.. The optical sensing subsystem is discussed in more detail, below..FIG. 4B.shows an elevation of the.watch body.202.shown in.FIG. 4A.. The exterior of the.watch body.202.is defined primarily by the.housing.206., the.transparent cover.208., and the.carrier.404.. The.carrier.404.supports the rear-facing.electrodes.412.,.414.(e.g., as described with reference to.FIGS. 4A, 4C, 5C, 5D, 5E, 6-8, 9A-9C., .10.A-.10.D). The.element.430.may represent the.crown.210.or.button.212.. For ease of explanation, it is noted that the positions of the.electrodes.412.,.414.on the.carrier.404.have been rotated 90 degrees with respect to their positions in.FIGS. 4A  4C...The.watch body.202.may be abutted to a user's.wrist.432.or other body part, and may be adhered to the user by the.watch band.204.or another element. When abutted to a user's.wrist.432., the.electrodes.412.,.414.on the.carrier.404.may contact the user's skin. The user may touch a conductive portion of the.element.430.with a.finger.434.. The user may touch the.element.430.in various ways, depending on where the.element.430.is conductive, and depending on the user's preference. In some cases, the user may touch the.element.430.while also touching their.wrist.432.. However, high skin-to-skin impedance tends to reduce the likelihood that signals will travel from the.electrodes.412.,.414., through their.wrist.432.to their.finger.434., and subsequently to the element.430.(or vice versa). In some cases, the user may touch the.element.430.while also touching the.housing.206., which may be okay if the.housing.206.is not conductive..FIG. 4C.shows an exploded view of components that may be attached to the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.shown in.FIGS. 4A  4B.. When the.watch body.202.shown in.FIGS. 4A  4B.is assembled, the components shown in.FIG. 4C.may reside within the.housing.206.. By way of example,.FIG. 4C.shows the components in relation to the back side housing member.402.(i.e., in relation to a skin-facing housing member)..In some cases, the interior components shown in.FIG. 4C.may be attached to (and in some cases directly on) the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.. The.interior surface.406.may sometimes be referred to as a first surface of the.carrier.404.. The components attached to the.carrier.404.may include a.lens.436., a.light filter.438., one or.more adhesives.440.,.442., the.optical sensor subsystem.416., circuitry or a.processing subsystem.444., a.magnet.446., or a.magnetic shield.448...The.lens.436.may abut, be attached to (and optionally, directly on), or be formed on the first or.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.. By way of example, the.lens.436.is aligned with the center of the.carrier.404.. In some cases, the interior or.exterior surface.406.,.408.of the.carrier.404.may have a.mask.422.thereon (e.g., an ink mask or dark mask, and in some cases a plurality of masks). The.mask.422.may define an opening.418.(e.g., a first opening or central opening) that allows light of at least one wavelength to pass through the.carrier.404., and the.lens.436.may be aligned with the.opening.418.. In some cases, the.lens.436.may be or include a Fresnel lens, a spherical lens, a diffuser film, or the like..In some cases, the.light filter.438.may include one or.more segments.450., and each.segment.450.may be attached to (e.g., laminated to) the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.and positioned on the interior surface (e.g., adjacent or around the lens.436.) to prevent a set of one or more light receivers of the.optical sensor subsystem.416.from receiving a portion of the light that is emitted by a set of one or more light emitters of the.optical sensor subsystem.416.. The set of light emitters and set of light receivers are not shown in.FIG. 4C., and may be attached to an underside of the.optical sensor subsystem.416.. When the.carrier.404.includes the.mask.422., the.mask.422.may further define a.second opening.420.a., or a set of.openings.420.including the.second opening.420.a.. The.second opening.420.a.or set of.openings.420.may be positioned adjacent or around the.first opening.418.. In these embodiments, the.segments.450.of the light filter.438.(or a light filter ring or other light filter configuration) may be aligned with (e.g., may cover) each of the openings in the set of.openings.420...As an example,.FIG. 4C.shows a.mask.422.that defines a set of eight.radial openings.420.around a.central opening.418.. Each.segment.450.of the.light filter.438.may block (e.g., absorb) a portion of light emitted by a set of light emitters that is attached to the.optical sensor subsystem.416., which portion of light reflects from a surface too close to (or within) the carrier.404.(e.g., the.exterior surface.408.of the.carrier.404., imperfections within the.carrier.404., or a medium too close to the carrier.404.), such that the reflected light is not useful in a sensing operation for which the.optical sensor subsystem.416.is designed. For example, when the.optical sensor subsystem.416.is configured to determine a biological parameter of a user, light reflected from the.carrier.404., or from the outer layer of skin of the user, may not have any relation to the biological parameter determined and may not be useful. Accordingly, the filter may be configured to filter out light frequencies associated with light reflected from the carrier and/or a skin surface, allowing light reflected from deeper skin layers, blood vessels, and the like to be received by the receiver(s). In some examples, the.light filter.438.or.segments.450.thereof may include at least one of a light control film, a light polarizer, an anti-reflective film, a reflective film, or a light absorber. Accordingly and as one non-limiting example, the.optical sensor subsystem.416.may act as an optical heart rate detector..In some embodiments, the.mask.422.may represent multiple masks, and different masks may allow different wavelengths of light to pass through the.carrier.404., as described for example with reference to.FIGS. 5A-5E  6...The.optical sensor subsystem.416.may include a.substrate.452.on which the set of one or more light emitters (e.g., LEDs) and the set of one or more light receivers (e.g., photodetectors, such as photodiodes) are attached. The light emitter(s) and light receiver(s) may be attached or positioned on the.substrate.452.to emit and receive light through the.carrier.404.. The.sensor subsystem.416.may be attached to the.carrier.404.by one or.more adhesives.440./.442., such as pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) or heat-activated films (HAFs). In some cases, the set of light emitters may be centrally attached on the.substrate.452., and a first wall may be attached to (e.g., formed on or bonded to) an underside of the.substrate.452.surrounding the set of light emitters. The first wall may be attached to the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.using a.first adhesive.440.. The set of light receivers may be attached on the.substrate.452.around the set of light emitters, between the first wall and a second wall attached to (e.g., formed on or bonded to) the underside of the.substrate.452.. The second wall may be attached to the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.using a second ring of.adhesive.442...The.substrate.452.of the.optical sensor subsystem.416.may include various contacts, pads, traces, or other.conductive structures.454.that enable the.processing subsystem.444.to be electrically coupled to the set of light emitters and set of light receivers of the.optical sensor subsystem.416.. The.processing subsystem.444.may include a substrate.456.(e.g., a printed circuit board (PCB)) that is attached to the.optical sensor subsystem.416., and thereby to the.carrier.404., via the.conductive structures.454.and/or additional adhesive between the.substrates.452.,.456.of the.optical sensor subsystem.416.and the.processing subsystem.444.. The.substrates.452.,.456.may also or alternatively be connected using mechanical fasteners (e.g., screws). The.processing subsystem.444.may activate the light emitters and light receivers to perform a sensor function (e.g., to determine a heart rate). In some cases, the.processing subsystem.444.may be attached to another structure within the watch body, and may be electrically connected to the.conductive structures.454.of the.optical sensor subsystem.416.by a flex circuit or other conductors..In some embodiments, the.substrate.456.of the.processing subsystem.444.may have a.hole.458.therein, and the.magnet.446.may be aligned with the.hole.458.and abutted to (or attached to) the.substrate.452.. In some cases, the.magnet.446.may be adhesively bonded to the.substrate.452.of the.optical sensor subsystem.416.. The.magnet.446.may inductively couple to a battery charger used for charging a battery included within the watch body, which battery may power components of the watch including the components of the.optical sensor subsystem.416.and the.processing subsystem.444...The.magnetic shield.448.may abut (or be attached to) the.magnet.446.. In some cases, the.magnetic shield.448.may be adhesively bonded to the.magnet.446.. The.magnetic shield.448.may direct magnetic flux associated with the.magnet.446.toward and out the.carrier.404.to improve inductive battery charging performance for a battery included within the.watch body.202...Direct or indirect connection of the components shown in.FIG. 4C.to the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.can reduce the height of the components when stacked..FIG. 4D.shows the.sensor subsystem.416.attached to the.carrier.404.shown in.FIGS. 4A-4C...FIG. 4B.also shows a.flex circuit.460., surrounding the.sensor subsystem.416., which may provide electrical connections between the.electrodes.412.,.414.and the.sensor subsystem.416.while also providing a ground that operates as an electrical noise mitigation barrier (or E-shield) between the.sensor subsystem.416.and the.electrodes.412.,.414.. The.electrodes.412.,.414.may be connected to the.electrical contacts.462.,.464., which.electrical contacts.462.,.464.are on the interior surface of the.carrier.404.and connected to both traces in the.flex circuit.460.and the.electrodes.412.,.414.. Traces in the.flex circuit.460.may be connected to the.electrical contacts.462.,.464.via a conductive epoxy, and may connect the.electrical contacts.462.,.464.to the.sensor subsystem.416.. A processor may be part of the.sensor subsystem.416., and the processor may be connected to another processor or other circuitry via a.flex circuit.466...FIGS. 5A-5E.illustrate an example of coatings that may be deposited on the interior and exterior surfaces of the.carrier.404.shown in.FIGS. 4A-4C.. As shown in.FIG. 5A., a first mask.500.(e.g., a first ink mask) that is opaque to infrared (IR) and visible light may be deposited (e.g., PVD deposited) on the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.. In some examples, the first mask.500.may include an.inner ring.500.a.and an.outer ring.500.b.that define a central.first opening.418.and a concentric second opening.506.(i.e., a.second opening.506.that is concentric with the first opening.418.). The central.first opening.418.may be positioned over light emitters of the.optical sensor subsystem.416.described with reference to.FIG. 4C.(and over the optional lens.436.), and the concentric.second opening.506.may be positioned above light receivers of the.sensor subsystem.416.. The.inner ring.500.a.of the first mask may prevent the light receivers from receiving light that is unlikely to have passed through a user's skin after passing through the central.first opening.418.. The.outer ring.500.b.of the first mask.500.may in some cases be provided for cosmetic reasons, and in some cases may not be provided..FIG. 5B.shows a second mask.508.(e.g., a second ink mask) that is opaque to visible light but transparent to IR light. The.second mask.508.may be deposited (e.g., PVD deposited) on the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.. The.second mask.508.may be deposited on the.carrier.404.over the concentric.second opening.506.in the first mask.500., and may overlap the inner and.outer rings.500.a.,.500.b.of the first mask, as shown in.FIG. 6.. The.second mask.508.may define a plurality of visible.light openings.420.above respective light receivers of the.optical sensor subsystem.416., while allowing IR light to pass through the entirety of the concentric.second opening.506.. This may increase the amount of IR light received by the light receivers. The.second mask.508.may also define an optional opening above a.condensation detector.512.. In some cases, the.second mask.508.may look visually similar to the first mask.500.(e.g., both masks may be dark masks, such that it may be impossible or difficult for a user to visually distinguish the first and second masks.500.,.508.)..FIGS. 5C and 5D.show an example of PVD deposited first and second electrodes.514.a.,.514.b.on the interior and.exterior surfaces.406.,.408.of the.carrier.404.. The first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.may be arc-shaped and positioned at the periphery of the.carrier.404.. The first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.may be sized based on factors such as: providing a sufficient area to provide good electrical contact between the.electrodes.412.,.414.and skin (which may improve electrical sensor efficiency); providing.electrodes.412.,.414.of a size that do not substantially interfere with an antenna or other electrical structures of a device (which may improve wireless communication efficiency); or providing.electrodes.412.,.414.positioned to allow optical communication through the carrier.404.(which may improve optical communication efficiency). The first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.may be separated from one another by a pair of.gaps.518.a.,.518.b..The first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.may be deposited on both the interior and.exterior surfaces.406.,.408.of the.carrier.404.and may wrap around the edge (or perimeter) of the.carrier.404.. The material used to form the first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.may be patterned to form.electrical contacts.520.a.,.520.b.(e.g., tabs) on the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.. The first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.may overlap the first mask.500.(or.outer ring.500.b.of the first mask) on the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404., such that the first mask.500.is positioned between the first and.second electrodes.412.,.414.and the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.. Thus, the material used to form the.electrodes.412.,.414.may need to have properties that enable the material to adhere to a carrier surface (e.g., a sapphire surface) and a mask (e.g., an ink mask). The material or materials used to form the.electrodes.412.,.414.may also have properties, singularly or in combination, such as: a low impedance and good conductivity (e.g., a low DC resistance); a low electrode-to-skin impedance; a high hardness to reduce scratching of the.electrodes.412.,.414.; a higher elastic modulus than the carrier.404.(e.g., to mitigate the likelihood that a crack in an.electrode.412.,.414.propagates through the carrier.404.); compatibility with a HAF or other adhesive; and good biocompatibility (e.g., not likely to cause an adverse reaction to a user of a device). In some embodiments, the.electrodes.412.,.414.may include aluminum titanium nitride (AlTiN) or chromium silicon carbonitride (CrSiCN). AlTiN and CrSiCN hold up well to abrasion and corrosion and tend not to place undue stresses on a sapphire carrier..FIG. 5E.shows an example deposition of adhesive on the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.. The adhesive may be deposited in inner and.outer rings.440.,.442., as described with reference to.FIG. 4C.. The.inner ring.440.of adhesive may be positioned on the.inner ring.500.a.of the first mask. The.outer ring.442.of adhesive may be positioned on the.second mask.508., outward from the plurality of.openings.420.in the.second mask.508.. In some cases, the adhesive may include a PSA or HAF..FIG. 6.shows a cross-section of the.carrier.404.shown in.FIG. 5B., and illustrates an overlap between the first and.second masks.500.,.508.. The.second mask.508.may overlap the first mask (e.g.,.outer ring.500.b.) on the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404.such that the first mask.500.is positioned between the.second mask.508.and the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404...FIG. 7.shows a cross-section of the.carrier.404.shown in.FIG. 5C or 5D., and illustrates an overlap between the first electrode.412.(or second electrode) and the first mask.500.(e.g.,.outer ring.500.b.of the first mask). The.first electrode.412.may overlap the first mask.500.(or.outer ring.500.b.of the first mask) on the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404., such that the first mask.500.is positioned between the.first electrode.412.and the.interior surface.406.of the.carrier.404...In some embodiments, the.electrodes.412.,.414.shown in.FIGS. 5C, 5D, and 7.may be formed using indium titanium oxide (ITO) or another transparent material. In these embodiments, the.electrodes.412.,.414.may be transparent to light emitted by a sensor subsystem positioned below the.carrier.404., and thus the.electrodes.412.,.414.may extend over a greater portion (or all) of the.exterior surface.408.of the.carrier.404...FIG. 8.shows an example layer construction of an ITO-based electrode. As shown, the.stack.800.may include a.layer.802.of aluminum oxide (Al.2.O.3.) on the carrier, a layer.804.of ITO on the.layer.802.of aluminum oxide, a.first layer.806.of silicon dioxide (SiO.2.) on the layer.804.of aluminum oxide, a.layer.808.of silicon nitride (Si.3.N.4.) on the.first layer.806.of silicon dioxide, a.second layer.810.of silicon dioxide on the.layer.808.of silicon nitride, and a.layer.812.of diamond like carbon, or another hard coating, on the.second layer.810.of silicon dioxide. Alternatively, the.layer.808.of silicon nitride and.second layer.810.of silicon dioxide may not be deposited, or only the layer.804.of ITO may be deposited, or just the layer.804.of ITO layer and.first layer.806.of silicon dioxide may be deposited. Other variations in the number or types of layers may also be used to form the.stack.800.. Each of the layers may be transparent to IR or visible light..FIGS. 9A-9C.show alternative electrical connections between an electrode (e.g., an electrode on an exterior surface of a carrier that forms part of a housing of an electronic device) and an electrical contact interior to the electronic device. In some examples, the carriers shown in cross-section in.FIGS. 9A-9C.may have circular perimeters. In other examples, the carriers may have perimeters that are oval-shaped, square-shaped, rectangular-shaped, and so on. The techniques described with reference to.FIGS. 9A-9C.can be applied to carriers having various perimeter shapes, to carriers having different compositions, and so on. In some embodiments, the features shown in.FIGS. 9-9C.may be replicated to electrically connect more than one electrode on an exterior surface of an electronic device to components interior to the electronic device..In.FIG. 9A., the.electrode.900.may be a thin film electrode that is PVD deposited on a.surface.902.of a.carrier.904.. The.surface.902.on which the.electrode.900.is deposited may be a surface of the.carrier.904.that is exterior to an electronic device (i.e., the.electrode.900.may be deposited on an.exterior surface.902.of the carrier.904.). As shown, a conductive material used to form the.electrode.900.may be deposited on the.carrier.904.such that the material wraps around an.edge.906.or perimeter of the.carrier.904.to form an.electrical contact.908.on a.surface.910.of the.carrier.904.that is interior to the electronic device (i.e., on an.interior surface.910.of the carrier.904.). In some cases, the.electrical contact.908.may be a tab that traces a much smaller arc about the periphery of the.carrier.904.than the electrode.900.(as shown, for example, in.FIGS. 5C, 5D, and 5E.). In other cases, the.electrical contact.908.may be arc-shaped and trace an arc that is similar in size to an arc traced by the.electrode.900.on the.exterior surface.902.of the.carrier.904...In some cases, the conductive material(s) used to form the.electrode.900.and.electrical contact.908.may be deposited on the.exterior surface.902.,.edge.906., and.interior surface.910.of the.carrier.904.in a single operation (or single set of operations in which the material(s) are deposited on the.exterior surface.902.,.edge.906., and.interior surface.910.of the carrier.904.). In other cases, the material(s) used to form the.electrode.900.may be deposited on the.edge.906.or.interior surface.910.of the.carrier.904.in operations that are performed separately from one or more operations in which the.electrode.900.is deposited on the.exterior surface.902.of the.carrier.904.. In these latter examples, the material(s) may be deposited such that the materials overlap. In some cases, a set of one or more materials used to form the.electrode.900.may differ from a set of one or more materials deposited on the.edge.906.or.interior surface.910.of the.carrier.904...In some embodiments, the conductive material(s) deposited on the.exterior surface.902.,.edge.906., and.interior surface.910.of the.carrier.904.may include a layer of SUS or a layer of DLC. In other embodiments, only the.electrode.900.or edge.906.of the.carrier.904.may be coated with a layer of stainless steel or DLC. In some examples, the conductive material(s) may include a PVD deposited layer of AlTiN or CrSiCN..In some embodiments, one or more masks (e.g., one or more ink masks) may be applied to the interior surface of the carrier (e.g., as described with reference to.FIGS. 5A-5E, 6., .7.). In these embodiments, one or more of the conductive materials used to form the.electrode.900.and.electrical contact.908.may be applied over the mask(s). The conductive material(s), and the manner in which the conductive material(s) are deposited on the.carrier.904., may therefore be selected to ensure adhesion of the conductive material(s) to the.carrier.904.and to the ink or other material used to form the mask(s)..As shown in.FIG. 9A., a peripheral band of the.interior surface.910.of the.carrier.904.may be attached to a recessed.ledge.912.in another.housing member.914.of the electronic device (e.g., with the.carrier.904.overlapping the housing member.914.). In such an embodiment, the.carrier.904.may be attached to the.housing member.914.using an adhesive.916., such as a heat-activated film (HAF). The adhesive.916.or conductive material(s), and the manner in which the.carrier.904.is attached to the.housing member.914., may therefore be selected to ensure adhesion of the.carrier.904.to the.housing member.914...The.electrical contact.908.may have a great enough width (e.g., a great enough width along a radius of the carrier.904.) that the.electrical contact.908.extends past the recessed.ledge.912.in the.housing member.914.when the.carrier.904.is attached to the.housing member.914., making the.electrical contact.908.accessible interior to the electronic device. In some cases, a flex circuit, other flexible conductor, or other conductive element may be soldered or otherwise electrically connected to the.electrical contact.908., to enable a signal to be received from or applied to the.electrode.900...In.FIG. 9B., the.electrode.918.may be a thin film electrode that is PVD deposited on a.surface.920.of a.carrier.922..

Prior to or after depositing the.electrode.918.on the.carrier.922., a thru-carrier via.924.may be drilled or otherwise cut into the.carrier.922.. The thru-carrier via.924.may extend from the.exterior surface.920.of the carrier.922.(or electrode.918.) to the.interior surface.926.of the.carrier.922.. The via.924.may be coated or filled with a.conductive material.928.such as stainless steel (SUS), and the.conductive material.928.may be covered by, overlap, or otherwise electrically connect to the.electrode.918.. In some cases, the.conductive material.928.in the via.924.may be molded or glued in the.via.924.. The.conductive material.928.may provide an.electrical contact.930.on a.surface.926.of the.carrier.922.that is interior to an electronic device (i.e., on an interior surface of the carrier). In some cases, the.conductive material.928.in the via.924.may overlap a portion of the.interior surface.926.of the.carrier.922., or may be connected to another conductive element deposited on the.interior surface.926.of the.carrier.922...The conductive material(s) used to form the.electrode.918.and deposited in the via.924.may be the same or different. In some embodiments, the conductive material(s) used to form the.electrode.918.may include a layer of stainless steel (SUS) or a layer of diamond like carbon (DLC). In some examples, the conductive material(s) may include a PVD deposited layer of Aluminum Titanium Nitride (AlTiN) or Chromium Silicon Carbon Nitride (CrSiCN)..As shown in.FIG. 9B., a peripheral band of the.interior surface.926.of the.carrier.922.may be attached to a recessed.ledge.932.in another.housing member.934.of the electronic device (e.g., with the.carrier.922.overlapping the housing member.934.). In such an embodiment, the.carrier.922.may be attached to the.housing member.934.using an adhesive.936., such as a HAF. The adhesive.936., and the manner in which the.carrier.922.is attached to the.housing member.934., may therefore be selected to ensure adhesion of the.carrier.922.to the.housing member.934...When the.carrier.922.is attached to the.housing member.934., the via.924.may be positioned such that it overlaps the recessed.ledge.932.or is interior to the recessed.ledge.932., making the.electrical contact.930.accessible interior to the electronic device. In some cases, a flex circuit, other flexible conductor, or other conductive element may be soldered or otherwise electrically connected to the.electrical contact.930., to enable a signal to be received from or applied to the.electrode.918...In.FIG. 9C., the.electrode.938.may be a metallic arc-shaped element positioned between a.carrier.940.and another.housing member.942.of an electronic device. In some embodiments, the.electrode.938.may be a singular metallic ring-shaped electrode (e.g., one electrode). In these embodiments, a peripheral band of a surface of the.carrier.940.that is interior to the electronic device (e.g., an.interior surface.944.of the carrier.940.) may be attached to a recessed.ledge.946.in the electrode.938.(e.g., with the.carrier.940.overlapping the electrode.938.), and the.electrode.938.may be attached to a recessed.ledge.950.in the housing member.942.(e.g., with the.electrode.938.overlapping the housing member.942.). In other embodiments, the.electrode.938.may be arc-shaped and may be one of two or more arc-shaped electrodes between the.carrier.940.and the.housing member.942.. In these embodiments, a peripheral band of the interior surface of the.carrier.940.may be attached to recessed.ledges.946.in multiple arc-shaped electrodes.938.(e.g., with the.carrier.940.overlapping the electrodes.938.), and each of the arc-shaped.electrodes.938.may be attached to the recessed.ledge.950.in the housing member.942.(e.g., with the.electrodes.938.overlapping the housing member.942.). In some cases, the multiple arc-shaped.electrodes.938.may be electrically isolated from each other by flexible seals or gaskets, or by rigid separators (e.g., rigid extensions of the.housing member.942., which rigid extensions may include extensions of the recessed.ledge.950.to which the.electrodes.938.are attached.

In some cases, the.first housing member.1046.may electrically insulate the.electrodes.1058.on the.carrier.1060.from the.second housing member.1052., or may provide a transition between incompatible materials, or may provide a support for the.carrier.1060., or may facilitate assembly of the housing of the electronic device..In some embodiments, one or more arc-shaped electrodes.1058.(e.g., two electrodes) may be positioned around the perimeter of the exterior surface of the.carrier.1060.. In other embodiments, the.electrodes.1058.may have other shapes or other positions on the.exterior surface.1062.of the.carrier.1060.. The.electrodes.1058.may be PVD deposited thin film electrodes. In some cases, the.electrodes.1058.may be connected to interior components of the electronic device by conductive material that wraps around the edge or perimeter of the carrier, or in any of the ways shown in.FIGS. 9A-9C...In some cases, components such as a sensor subsystem may be attached to the.interior surface.1048.of the.carrier.1060...Turning now to the implementation of an electrode on a crown,.FIG. 11A.shows an example elevation of a crown assembly.1100.. The crown assembly.1100.may be an example of a crown assembly included in any of the electronic devices described with reference to.FIG. 1A, 1B, 2A-2C, 3, 4A., or.4.B. The crown assembly.1100.may include a.crown.210...The.crown.210.may be mechanically and electrically connected to a.shaft.1102.that extends through an opening in a housing. By way of example, the housing is shown to be the.housing.206.of the.watch body.202.described with reference to.FIGS. 2A-2C, 3, 4A., .4.B. The.crown.210.may be integrally formed from a single piece of material that includes the shaft.1102.(that is, they may be connected to one another), or the.shaft.1102.may be semi-permanently attached to a.crown body.1104.using a fastening means such as solder, threads, or an adhesive. The crown.210.(or at least the crown body.1104.) may be external to the.housing.206., and may be rotated and/or translated by a user of the electronic device incorporating the crown assembly.1100.. Further, although the.crown body.1104.and.shaft.1102.are shown as integrally formed in.FIGS. 11A and 11B., it should be appreciated that they may be separate pieces that are joined together..The crown assembly.1100.may further include a.shaft retainer.1106.receiving an end of the.shaft.1102.. The.shaft retainer.1106.may be mechanically and/or electrically connected to the shaft.1102.(e.g., using solder, threads, or an adhesive), interior to the.housing.206.. The.shaft retainer.1106.may retain the.crown.210.in position in relation to the.housing.206...One or more insulators.1108.(e.g., electrical insulators) may electrically insulate the.crown.210.and/or.shaft.1102.from the.housing.206.. The term insulator encompasses both a single insulator and multiple insulators taken as a set. The.insulator.1108.is generally shown in.FIG. 11.as an annular seal having an L-shaped profile, functioning as a collar for the shaft. The.shaft.1102.and.crown body.1104.may translate, moving toward and away from the.housing.206.while the.insulator.1108.and.shaft retainer.1106.move with the.shaft.1102.. In some embodiments, the.insulator.1108.may be stationary relative to the.housing.206.while the.shaft.1102.,.crown body.1104.and.shaft retainer.1106.move..The.insulator.1108.or seal electrically insulates the.shaft.1102.from the.housing.206., and may also electrically insulate the.housing.206.from the.shaft retainer.1106.. In some embodiments, the.insulator.1108.may alternatively include more than one element and/or be positioned elsewhere within the crown assembly.1100.. For example, the.insulator.1108.may include an element, layer, or coating.1108.a.applied to a surface of the.housing.206.that faces an underside of the.crown.210., or to other elements that face the underside of the.crown.210...A.tactile switch.1110.may be axially aligned with the.shaft.1102.and positioned at an end of the.shaft.1102.opposite the.crown body.1104.. By way of example, the.tactile switch.1110.may be attached on a.substrate.1112.. The.tactile switch.1110.may be actuated (e.g., switched between two or more states) as the.shaft.1102.translates along an axis of the.shaft.1102.to provide a crown input. A spring-biased.conductor.1114.may be mechanically and electrically connected to at least one of the.shaft.1102.or the.shaft retainer.1106., and in.FIG. 11.is shown to be connected to the.shaft retainer.1106.. The spring-biased.conductor.1114.may be biased to electrically contact the.shaft.1102.and/or.shaft retainer.1106.during all phases of rotation and translation of the.crown.210., and may electrically connect the.shaft.1102.and/or.shaft retainer.1106.to a circuit.1116.(e.g., a processor). When the crown is translated by a user, the spring-biased.conductor.1114.may deform to maintain electrical contact with the.shaft.1102.and/or.shaft retainer.1106...The crown assembly.1100.may further include an.optical encoder.1118.. The.optical encoder.1118.may be used to detect rotation and/or translation of the.shaft.1102.or.shaft retainer.1106.. In some embodiments, the.circuit.1116.and.optical encoder.1118.may be attached to the same substrate as the.tactile switch.1110...In some embodiments, the entirety of the.crown.210.or.crown body.1104.may be conductive and function as an electrode. The.conductive crown body.1104.may be electrically connected to the.circuit.1116.via the.shaft.1102.,.shaft retainer.1106., and spring-biased.conductor.1114.. In other embodiments, only a portion of the.crown.210.or.crown body.1104.may be conductive and function as an electrode, and the conductive portion of the.crown body.1104.may be electrically connected to the.circuit.1116.via the.shaft.1102.,.shaft retainer.1106., and spring-biased.conductor.1114...Because the signals received by or propagated from the.crown.210.may be low voltage or low amplitude signals, the materials, positions, electrical connections to, and electrical routing paths for an electrode formed on or by the.crown.210.can have a significant impact on the ability of the.circuit.1116.to discern useful signals representing an ECG or other biological parameter of a person wearing an electronic device including the crown assembly.1100.. The materials, positions, electrical connections to, and electrical routing paths for the crown assembly.1100.can also determine how well the crown assembly.1100.receives voltages/signals from a person's skin (e.g., a SNR of a device-to-user interface through which the voltages/signals pass); how well voltages/signals are transferred between the.crown.210.and internal components of an electronic device (e.g., a voltage/signal propagation SNR); and how well the crown assembly.1100.operates in the face of environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, moisture, electromagnetic radiation, dust, and so on. In some cases, the.insulator.1108.may be positioned to prevent moisture from electrically shorting the.crown.210.to the.housing.206., or the.housing.206.may be grounded to provide electrical shielding for some or all of the signals propagated through the crown assembly.1100., or the interfaces between the.shaft.1102.and the.shaft retainer.1106., or between the.shaft retainer.1106.and the spring-biased.conductor.1114., may be configured to increase SNR and reduce signal attenuation..In some embodiments, the.crown.210.may include a coating, layer, or the like.1120.(coating.1120.) that electrically isolates the.crown.210.. The coating may thus function as, have similar properties to, and/or be made from the same or similar materials as, the.insulator.1108.. Generally, the coating.1120.prevents electrical connection between the.crown.210.and the.housing.206., for example when water is present in the space between the crown and housing..In the absence of the coating.1120., water, sweat, or another conductor may electrically bridge or short the.crown.210.to the.housing.206., presuming both the crown and housing are made from (or incorporate) an electrical conductor such as metal. In the event the.crown.210.or some portion thereof serves as an electrode for measuring an electrocardiogram, shorting the.crown.210.to the housing.206.(and thus to the skin of a wearer) may render the crown inoperable or the electrocardiogram unreliable..The coating.1120.serves as a barrier against shorting the.crown.210.to the.housing.206.or other electrically conductive material or body, thereby ensuring the electrical functionality of the.crown.210.. In some embodiments the coating.1120.coats only those surfaces of the crown that oppose or face the housing; in other embodiments and as shown in.FIG. 11A., the.coating.1108.a.may extend across one or more sides of the.crown.210.. Further, the coating.1120.may extend onto a top or outer surface of the crown.210.(e.g., the surface of the crown that does not oppose or face the housing.206.), although typically at least a portion of the outer surface is not covered by the coating in order to define an area of the crown that can electrically couple to a wearer's finger..The coating.1120.also may extend at least partly down a shaft of the.crown.210., as discussed in more detail with respect to.FIG. 11B...In some embodiments, a second coating.1122.may be applied to the.housing.206.instead of, or in addition to, the coating.1120.on the.crown.210.. This housing coating.1122.serves the same function as the crown coating.1120., namely electrically insulating the.housing.206.from the.crown.210.when water or other electrical conductors are in the gap between the housing and crown. The housing coating.1122.may extend across the insulator.1108.(or a non-insulating collar), in some embodiments. Likewise, the housing coating.1122.may extend between the.housing.206.and.insulator.1108.in some embodiments, or may be an extension of the insulator..In some embodiments, the coatings.1120.,.1122.may improve wear or provide a cosmetic function (e.g., provide an accent or visually conceal a surface of the shaft, crown, and/or housing) for the crown assembly.1100.. Alternatively, the.housing.206., or that portion of the.housing.206.that faces the.crown.210., may be formed from a material that operates as an electrical insulator (e.g., plastic, ceramic, or the like). In some embodiments, one or more of the insulators.1108.(including element, layer, or coating.1108.a.or.1120.) may by overmolded liquid crystal polymer (LCP) elements or coatings, which can provide very good separation resistance (high separation resistance) between moving or other parts. LCP layers may also be used in place of polyimide layers in flex circuits and other elements, and may not require the use of temperature or moisture-sensitive adhesives. LCP elements, layers, and coatings absorb less moisture than polyimides in high temperature and high humidity environments, which can be useful in maintaining high separation resistance between components when sensing low voltage signals (e.g., biometric signals of a person) under varying conditions (e.g., under non-controlled conditions outside a doctor's office or hospital). LCP elements, layers, and coatings also maintain good separation resistance high temperatures. Other elements, layers, or coatings that may be used to provide electrical isolation include silicone or acrylic elements, layers, or coatings, or other elements having a high surface resistance. Other examples of insulators or insulator positions are described with reference to.FIGS. 11B, 12A, 12B, 13., .14...FIG. 11B.shows another.example crown.210.extending through a.housing.206.of an electronic watch. As with other embodiments described herein, the.crown.210.may be used to provide multiple types of input. For example, the crown may rotate about an axis of rotation (typically extending along a center length of the.shaft.1102., from an exterior of the.housing.206.to an interior of the housing) to provide a first type of crown input, translate along the axis of rotation (e.g., move towards and/or away from the housing.206.) to provide a second type of crown input, and be touch-sensitive to provide a third type of crown input. The first and second types of input may control graphical output on the electronic watch's display, as described below in more detail with respect to.FIGS. 26A-28B.. The third type of input may be a measurement of an electrical signal (such as voltage, capacitance, current, or the like), or facilitating measurements of a differential in an electrical signal, to provide an ECG of a user. That is and as discussed in greater detail herein, the third type of input may be the.crown.210.functioning as one of two electrodes in an electrical circuit configured to measure a user's ECG. Typically, although not necessarily, the second electrode is positioned a back of the electronic watch. This second electrode and its functionality is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this document..The.crown.210.may be formed from multiple elements attached together, as discussed in more detail below, or may be a single piece and connected to one another. The.crown.210.generally includes a.crown body.1104.coupled to (or formed with) a.shaft.1102.. The.shaft.1102.of the crown may extend through the.housing.206.and is typically received in, or passes through, a collar.1124.. The collar.1124.may restrict tilting of the.shaft.1102.and.crown body.1104.. Further, the collar.1124.may permit translation of the.shaft.1102.and.crown body.1104.toward and away from the housing and rotation of the shaft and.crown body.1104.about the axis of rotation. The collar.1124.may be the same as, or similar to, the.shaft retainer.1106.and/or.insulator.1108.of.FIG. 11A...One or more O-.rings.1134.are fitted about the.shaft.1102.and within the collar.1124.. The O-.rings.1134.may be received within grooves, depressions, or the like within one or both of the.shaft.1102.and collar.1124.. The O-rings form a watertight seal and likewise reduce or eliminate contaminants passing into an interior of the.housing.206.through the.gap.1136.between the.crown.210.and.housing.206.. The O-.rings.1134.may also permit the shat to rotate and/or translate while restricting (or helping to restrict) how far the.shaft.1102.translates..As with the embodiment shown in.FIG. 11A., the.crown.210.may short to the.housing.206.if water or another conductor is present in the.gap.1136.between the crown and housing and the two are not electrically insulated from one another. Shorting the.crown.210.to the.housing.206.results in the electronic watch unreliably measuring and displaying an ECG of a user or not functioning at all..Accordingly and similar to the embodiment of.FIG. 11A., an underside of the.crown.210.may be coated with an electrically insulating.coating.1132.. The.coating.1132.may prevent water or another contaminant from acting as a short or ground path between the.crown.210.and.housing.206.. As discussed with respect to.FIG. 11A.and shown in that figure, such a coating may be applied to the.housing.206.in addition to, or instead of, the.crown.210...The.crown.210.shown in.FIG. 11B.is not formed from a single piece of material but instead is formed from multiple elements. The.crown body.1104.and.shaft.1102.may be formed from or as a single piece of material, for example metal or another suitable conductor, and provide an electrical path between an object touching the.crown body.1104.and a sensor within the.housing.206., such as the.third sensor.230.discussed above. An insulating.split.1146.may separate the crown body from a.trim.1148.; the.trim.1148.may be annular, square, or any other suitable shape. The trim and split.1146.may provide various aesthetic looks as well as functional properties, such as different wear resistance, environmental resistance, and the like as compared to the.crown body.1104.. Accordingly, the.trim.1148.may be made from the same material or a different material as the.crown body.1104.and the.shaft.1102...Insofar as the.split.1146.is an electrical insulator, the.coating.1132.need not extend across the split or onto any portion of the trim.1148.(although it can in some embodiments). Thus, the.coating.1132.may stop at an edge of the.crown body.1104.abutting the.split.1146.. This may reduce manufacturing and assembly complexity of embodiments, as well as provide cost savings..In addition to, or instead of, providing a.coating.1132.on the.crown.210.or.housing.206., the collar.1124.may be coated. For example, an electrically insulating.coating.1126.may be deposited on the collar.1124.and serve to electrically insulate the collar from the.housing.206.and/or.crown.210.. This may be useful when the collar is made from an electrically conductive material and the.crown.210.may be shorted to the collar.1124., in addition to or instead of to the.housing.206...As one non-limiting example, capillary action may retain water (or another liquid) in a portion of the gap between the collar.1124.and.crown.210.while the part of the.gap.1136.between the crown and.housing.206.is sized to permit water to drain out. Thus, in such an embodiment the.crown.210.may be at risk of electrically shorting to the collar.1124.but not the.housing.206.. It should be appreciated that in some embodiments the.housing.206.and/or.crown.210.may be coated as well as the collar.1124.. It should likewise be appreciated that any or all of the electrically insulating coatings described herein may attenuate noise with respect to a signal conducted from the.crown body.1104.through the.shaft.1102.to a sensor, thereby providing more accurate and/or faster readings of a biological parameter such as an ECG..Although the coating.1126.(and coating.1132.) has been discussed as an electrical insulator, it should be appreciated that the coating(s) may provide other properties in addition to, or instead of, electrical insulation. For example, the.coating.1126.may reduce friction between the collar.1124.and.shaft.1102.as the.shaft.1102.rotates and/or translates. The.coating.1126.may reduce wear on either or both of the collar.1124.and.shaft.1102.as another example..Further, in some embodiments the.gap.1136.between the.crown.210.and.housing.206.may be large enough that the collar.1124.may be visible. In order to obscure the first collar coating and/or the collar, a.second collar coating.1128.may be applied over the first, insulating.collar coating.1126.. The.second collar coating.1128.may be darker or otherwise visually conceal the.first collar coating.1128.and collar.1124.from the naked eye..As yet another option, the.second coating.1128.may also provide environmental resistance and/or resist wear, tear, and/or friction between the collar.1124.and.shaft.1102., as described above. Thus, the.first collar coating.1126.may be an electrical insulator while the.second collar coating.1128.may be chosen for its other material properties and/or resistances. Similarly, the first collar coating may be chosen for its material properties and/or resistances (including functioning as an electrical insulator) and the second collar coating may be used to obscure the first collar coating..Any or all of the coatings described herein may be deposited in a number of ways, including electrophoretic deposition or other manners that are suitable and known in the art. Likewise, any or all of the coatings may incorporate materials such as titanium dioxide, Teflon, or the like to provide or enhance properties such as resistance to wear, lowering of friction between adjacent elements, and the like. In some embodiments the first collar coating.1126.(or any other coating) may be approximately 10-30 microns thick or even 5-50 microns. The second collar coating.1128.(or any other coating) may be thinner on the order of 3-5 microns or even 2-10 microns..More detailed examples of the crown assembly.1100.described with reference to.FIG. 11A.are shown in.FIGS. 12A, 12B, 13., .14...Turning now to.FIGS. 12A  12B., there is shown an example of a.crown assembly.1200., as may be included in any of the electronic devices described with reference to.FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2A-2C, 3, 4A., or.4.B..FIG. 12A.shows an exploded view of the.crown assembly.1200., and.FIG. 12B.shows an assembled cross-section of the.crown assembly.1200., as viewed from the front or rear face of an electronic device such as the.watch body.202.described with reference to.FIGS. 2A-2C, 3, 4A., .4.B..The.crown assembly.1200.is an example of the crown assembly.1100.shown in.FIG. 11., and includes components corresponding to the.crown.210.,.shaft retainer.1106.,.insulator.1108.,.tactile switch.1110.,.substrate.1112., spring-biased.conductor.1114.,.circuit.1116., and.optical encoder.1118...The.crown assembly.1200.may include a conductive.rotatable shaft.1202.configured to extend through an opening in a housing.1242.(see.FIG. 12B.), such as the housing described with reference to.FIG. 2A, 2C, 3, 4A, 4B., or.11.. A user-.rotatable crown.1204.may be mechanically attached to the.shaft.1202.exterior to the.housing.1242.. The.crown.1204.may be rotated by a user of an electronic watch, to in turn rotate the.shaft.1202.. In some cases, the.crown.1204.may also be pulled or pushed by the user to translate the.shaft.1202.along its axis. The.crown.1204.may be electrically connected to a circuit within the.housing.1242., but electrically isolated from the.housing.1242...The.crown.1204.may be electrically connected to the.shaft.1202.. In some cases, at least part of the.crown.1204.and at least part of the.shaft.1202.may be molded, machined, or otherwise formed together (e.g., from a same material, such as a conductive ceramic or stainless steel)..In some embodiments, the.crown.1204.may be formed of a conductive ceramic or stainless steel (or have a conductive ceramic or stainless steel core). The core may be coated in a PVD deposited layer of SUS or DLC, or an electro-deposited (ED) layer of AlTiN or CrSiCN, and may function as an electrode. In some embodiments, the.crown.1204.may have a.conductive crown body.1244.surrounded by a.ring.1246.of non-conductive material (or other insulator). See,.FIG. 12B.. The.non-conductive ring.1246.may help prevent shorting of the.crown.1204.to the.housing.1242.. The.ring.1246.of non-conductive material may in some cases be surrounded by another.ring.1248.of conductive material. In the configuration shown, the.ring.1248.may optionally contact and electrically short to a grounded.housing.1242.when the crown is pressed, thereby helping to electrically shield the.conductive crown body.1244.of the.crown.1204.from some sources of interference. In some embodiments, the.crown.1204.may have a conductive surface covered by a thin non-conductive coating. The non-conductive coating may provide a dielectric for capacitive coupling between the conductive surface and skin of a user of the crown.1204.(or an electronic watch or other device that includes the crown assembly.1200.). In the same or different embodiments, the.crown.1204.may have a non-conductive coating on a surface of the.crown.1204.facing the.housing.1242...A.shaft retainer.1206.may be mechanically connected to the.shaft.1202., interior to the housing.1242.(e.g., interior to a watch body housing), after the shaft is inserted through the opening in the.housing.1242.with the.crown.1204.positioned exterior to the.housing.1242.. In some cases, the.shaft retainer.1206.may include a nut, and the.shaft.1202.may have a threaded male portion that engages a threaded female portion of the nut. In some cases, the.shaft retainer.1206.may be conductive, or have a conductive coating thereon, and mechanical connection of the.shaft retainer.1206.to the.shaft.1202.may form an electrical connection between the.shaft retainer.1206.and the.shaft.1202.. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the.shaft retainer.1206.may be integrally formed with the.shaft.1202., and the.shaft.1202.may be inserted through the opening in the.housing.1242.from inside the.housing.1242.and then attached to the crown.1204.(e.g., the.crown.1204.may screw onto the shaft.1202.)..In some embodiments, a.collar.1208.may be aligned with the opening in the.housing.1242., and a.collar retainer.1210.may be coupled to the.collar.1208.to retain the.collar.1208.to the.housing.1242.from a side of the.housing.1242.opposite a side of the.housing.1242.in which the.collar.1208.is inserted. In some embodiments, the.collar retainer.1210.may be coupled to the.collar.1208.via threads on a male portion of the.collar.1208.and corresponding threads on a female portion of the.collar retainer.1210.. Optionally, a gasket.1212.(e.g., an I-ring) made of a synthetic rubber and fluoropolymer elastomer (e.g., Viton), silicone, or another compressible material may be placed over the.collar.1208.prior to insertion of the.collar.1208.through the opening, and attachment of the.collar retainer.1210.to the.collar.1208.may compress the.gasket.1212.. The.compressed gasket.1212.may provide stability to the.collar.1208.and.collar retainer.1210., or provide a moisture barrier between the.collar.1208.and the.housing.1242.. The.collar.1208.and.collar retainer.1210.may be attached to one another, and thereby to the.housing.1242., prior to insertion of the.shaft.1202.through the.collar.1208.. Another gasket.1214.(e.g., a Y-ring) made of Viton, silicone, or another compressible material may be placed over the.collar.1208., before or after insertion of the.collar.1208.through the opening, but before the.shaft.1202.is inserted through the.collar.1208.. The.second gasket.1214.may provide a moisture barrier between the.crown.1204.and the.housing.1242.or the.crown.1204.and the.collar.1208...Also prior to inserting the.shaft.1202.through the.collar.1208., and in some cases prior to inserting the.collar.1208.into the opening in the.housing.1242., an.insulator.1216.may be inserted into or deposited on the interior of the.collar.1208., or placed around or deposited on the.shaft.1202.. The.insulator.1216.may also be inserted, placed, or deposited as the.shaft.1202.is inserted into the.collar.1208.. In some cases, the.insulator.1216.may include a non-conductive sleeve or bushing (e.g., a plastic sleeve) inserted (e.g., press-fit) into the collar.1208.(e.g., into a portion of the.collar.1208.positioned interior to the housing.1242.). The.insulator.1216.may also or alternatively include a non-conductive sleeve overmolded on the collar (e.g., molded within the opening in the.collar.1208.and over a surface of the.collar.1208.facing the crown.1204.). In some cases, the.insulator.1216.may be an overmolded liquid crystal polymer (LCP).insulator.1216.. The.insulator.1216.may also or alternatively include a non-conductive coating on the collar.1208.(e.g., on an inner surface of the collar.1208.), or a non-conductive coating on the.shaft.1202., or a set of one or more non-conductive gaskets surrounding the.shaft.1202.. When the.shaft.1202.is inserted into the.collar.1208., the.insulator.1216.may be positioned between the.shaft.1202.and the.collar.1208.and help to insulate a conductive portion of the shaft.1202.(or the entire shaft.1202.) from the.collar.1208...Another.insulator.1218.may be positioned between the.shaft retainer.1206.and the.collar retainer.1210.. For example, a non-conductive (e.g., plastic) washer, plate, or shim may be attached to the interior of the.collar retainer.1210., between the.shaft retainer.1206.and the.collar retainer.1210.. In some cases, the non-conductive washer may be carried by a.plate.1220., such as a plate formed of stainless steel (e.g., the.insulator.1218.may be an overmolded LCP insulator.1218.). In these cases, the non-conductive washer may be attached to the interior of the.collar retainer.1210.by welding (e.g., laser welding) the.plate.1220.to the.collar retainer.1210.. The non-conductive washer or other element may provide a bearing surface for the.shaft retainer.1206...As shown in.FIGS. 12A  12B., one or more O-.rings.1222.,.1224.or other gaskets may be placed over the.shaft.1202.before the.shaft.1202.is inserted into the.collar.1208.. The O-.rings.1222.,.1224.may be formed of a synthetic rubber, fluoropolymer elastomer, silicone, or another compressible material. The O-.rings.1222.,.1224.may maintain the.shaft.1202.in a position that is centered within the.collar.1208.. In some cases, the O-.rings.1222.,.1224.may provide a seal between the.shaft.1202.and the.collar.1208.. The O-.rings.1222.,.1224.may also function as an insulator between the.shaft.1202.and the.collar.1208.. In some embodiments, the O-.rings.1222.,.1224.may be fitted to recesses in the.shaft.1202.. Additionally, a low-.friction ring.1306.or filler may be placed around the top of the.collar.1208., between the.crown.1204.and the.collar.1208.. Alternatively, the low-.friction ring.1250.or filler may be attached to the.crown.1204., between the.crown.1204.and the.collar.1208.. In some embodiments, the.shaft.1202.may be smooth (not shown) and rotate within a thicker or closer.fitting insulator.1216.without use of the O-.rings.1222.,.1224...In some embodiments, a.bracket.1226.may be attached (e.g., laser welded) to the.collar retainer.1210.or another element within the.housing.1242.. The.bracket.1226.may support a spring-biased.conductor.1228.and maintain the spring-biased.conductor.1228.in mechanical and electrical contact with the shaft retainer.1206.(or in some cases with an end of the.shaft.1202., such as when the shaft extends through the shaft retainer (not shown)). As shown, the spring-biased.conductor.1228.may include a shear plate that is spring-biased about an.axis.1238., which.axis.1238.is perpendicular to and radially outward from a.second axis.1240.of the.shaft.1202.. By way of example, the shear plate is shown to be circular, although the shear plate could also have other shapes. In some embodiments, the surface of the shear plate that abuts the.shaft retainer.1206.or shaft end may be hardened (e.g., with a PVD deposited coating of cobalt chromium (CoCr or hard chromium)) to mitigate the likelihood of the.shaft retainer.1206.or shaft end wearing through the shear plate after multiple rotations or translations of the.shaft.1202.. The shear plate (and in some cases the entirety of the spring-biased conductor.1228.) may be plated with gold or another material to improve electrical conductivity (e.g., prior to coating the shear plate with a hardener). In some cases, the spring-biased.conductor.1228.may be formed (e.g., stamped or bent) from a piece of metal (e.g., stainless steel). In other cases, the spring-biased.conductor.1228.may be formed in other ways. The length and thickness of the shear plate, perpendicular to the axis of the.shaft.1202., can be optimized to provide a balance between a high enough spring constant to ensure good electrical contact between the shear plate and the.shaft retainer.1206.or shaft end (even during rotation of the shaft.1202.), on one hand, and a low enough spring constant to mitigate the likelihood that the.shaft retainer.1206.or shaft end will wear through the shear plate (or through a coating thereon). A flat or relatively flat shear plate can reduce the dimension of the.crown assembly.1200.along the.axis.1240.of the.shaft.1202...In some embodiments, a majority or entirety of the.shaft.1202.,.shaft retainer.1206., or.crown.1204.may be coated with a non-conductive coating, but for an external conductive surface of the.crown.1204.and a portion of the.shaft.1202.or.shaft retainer.1206.that contacts the spring-biased.conductor.1228...When the.shaft.1202.is translatable, translation of the.shaft.1202.into the housing.1242.(e.g., into the housing of a watch body) may cause the spring-biased conductor.1228.(or the shear plate thereof) to deform. However, the spring bias of the spring-biased.conductor.1228.may cause the spring-biased conductor.1228.(or the shear plate thereof) to maintain electrical contact with the shaft retainer or shaft end, regardless of whether the.shaft.1202.is in a first position or a second position with reference to translation of the.shaft.1202.. The spring-biased.conductor.1228.may be electrically connected to a circuit, such as a circuit formed on or in a.substrate.1230.such as a flex circuit or printed circuit board (PCB). In some cases, the spring-biased.conductor.1228.may be surface-attached to the circuit substrate.1230.(such as soldered or otherwise mechanically connected, for example by using a surface-mount technology process), which.circuit substrate.1230.may be supported by the rigid support member (or sub-housing frame member).1226.. A conductive grease may be deposited between the.shaft retainer.1206.or.shaft.1202.and the shear plate or other member of the spring-biased.conductor.1228.. The circuit may be in electrical communication with the.crown.1204.via the spring-biased.conductor.1228., the.shaft retainer.1206., and the shaft.1202.(or when an end of the.shaft.1202.protrudes through the.shaft retainer.1206., the circuit may be in electrical communication with the.crown.1204.via the spring-biased.conductor.1228.and the shaft.1202.)..A tactile (tac).switch.1252., such as a dome switch, may be electrically connected to the circuit and mechanically connected to the.circuit substrate.1230.. In some cases, the.tac switch.1252.may be surface-attached to the circuit substrate.1230.(such as soldered or otherwise mechanically connected). The shear plate of the spring-biased.conductor.1228.may be positioned between the.shaft retainer.1206.and the.tac switch.1252.. The.tac switch.1252.may be actuated or change state in response to translation of the.shaft.1202.. Thus, when a user presses on the.crown.1204., the.shaft.1202.may translate into the housing.1242.(e.g., into the housing of a watch body) and actuate the.tac switch.1252., placing the.tac switch.1252.in one of a number of states. When the user releases pressure on the.crown.1204.or pulls the.crown.1204.outward from the.housing.1242., the.tac switch.1252.may retain the state in which it was placed when pressed, or advance to another state, or toggle between two states, depending on the type or configuration of the.tac switch.1252...The circuit to which the.tac switch.1252.and spring-biased.conductor.1228.are electrically connected may be part of, or electrically connected to, one or more circuits that carry portions of an.optical encoder.1232.and other circuit elements, such as an.interface.1234.to the electrodes described with reference to.FIGS. 5C, 5D, 5E, 6-8, 9A-9C., .10.A-.10.D, or a processor that receives and processes signals received from or provided to the.crown.1204.or other electrodes. By way of example,.FIG. 12A.shows a circuit.1236.(e.g., a flex circuit or PCB) to which a set of one or more light emitters and light detectors of an.optical encoder.1232.is connected. The light emitter(s) may illuminate an encoder pattern or other rotating portion of the.optical encoder.1232., which encoder pattern or other rotating portion of the.optical encoder.1232.may be carried on (e.g., formed on, printed on, etc.) the.shaft retainer.1206.. The light detector(s) may receive reflections of the light emitted by the light emitter(s), and a processor may determine a direction of rotation, speed of rotation, angular position, translation, or other state(s) of the.crown.1204.and.shaft.1202...The spring-biased.conductor.1228.may be connected to a processor. The processor may be attached or coupled to one or more of the circuits shown in.FIG. 12A.. The processor may determine whether a user is touching the.crown.1204., or determine a biological parameter of the user based on a signal received from or provided to the user via the.crown.1204., or determine other parameters based on signals received from or provided to the.crown.1204.. In some cases, the processor may operate the crown and electrodes described in.FIGS. 5C, 5D, 5E, 6-8, 9A-9C, 10A-10D, 11, 12A., .12.B as an electrocardiogram and provide an ECG to a user of a watch including the crown and electrodes..In an alternate embodiment of the.crown assembly.1200.shown in.FIGS. 12A  12B., the spring-biased.conductor.1228.may include a conductive brush that is biased to contact a side of the.shaft.1202.or a side of the.shaft retainer.1206.. The conductive brush may maintain electrical contact with the.shaft.1202.or.shaft retainer.1206.through rotation or translation of the.shaft.1202., and may be electrically connected to a circuit such as the circuit that supports the tac switch.1352...FIG. 13.shows a cross-section of a.crown assembly.1300.as viewed from an edge of a watch body (e.g., an edge to which a watch band might be attached). The.crown assembly.1300.shown in.FIG. 13.differs from the.crown assembly.1200.shown in.FIGS. 12A  12B.in that the.crown.1302.has a somewhat different configuration. For example, the.crown.1302.has a.conductive crown body.1304.surrounded by a.non-conductive ring.1306.. The.non-conductive ring.1306.may be attached to the.conductive crown body.1304.by an adhesive.1308.. Alternatively, the.ring.1306.may be conductive, and may be insulated from the.conductive crown body.1304.by the adhesive.1308.(e.g., when the adhesive.1308.is non-conductive) or electrically connected to the conductive crown body.1304.(e.g., when the adhesive.1308.is conductive)..As shown in.FIG. 13., the.crown assembly.1300.may be positioned adjacent a transparent cover.1310.(e.g., a carrier) under which a display may be attached, such that the display is at least partially or fully within the housing. In some cases, the display may be a touch-sensitive display. In some embodiments, the display may also be a force-sensitive display..FIG. 13.shows one example of a force sensor.1312.for a force-sensitive display, in which a compressible gasket.1314.is bounded by first and.second capacitive plates.1316.,.1318.and positioned between the.carrier.1310.and the.housing.1242...FIG. 14.shows a cross-section of a.crown assembly.1400., as may be included in any of the electronic devices described with reference to.FIG. 1A, 1B, 2A-2C, 3, 4A., or.4.B. Similarly to the.crown assemblies.1200.and.1300.shown in.FIGS. 12A, 12B., .13., the.crown assembly.1400.is an example of the crown assembly.1100.shown in.FIG. 11...The.crown assembly.1400.is similar to the.crown assembly.1200.in that its.crown.1402.has a.conductive crown body.1404.surrounded by an.inner ring.1406.of non-conductive material and an.outer ring.1408.of conductive material. The.conductive crown body.1404.may be formed of a conductive ceramic or stainless steel, and may be coated in a PVD deposited layer of SUS or DLC, or an ED layer of AlTiN or CrSiCN, and may function as an electrode. The non-conductive.inner ring.1406.may help prevent shorting of the.crown.1402.to the.housing.1242., and may be formed of a plastic or elastomer, for example. The conductive.outer ring.1408.may be formed of the same or different material(s) as the.conductive crown body.1404...The non-conductive.inner ring.1406.may extend from an outer surface of the.crown.1402.to under a portion of the.conductive crown body.1404.. In this manner, the non-conductive.inner ring.1406.may prevent the.conductive crown body.1404.from contacting the.collar.1208.when the.crown.1402.is translated toward the.housing.1242...The conductive.outer ring.1408.may extend from an outer surface of the.crown.1402.to under a portion of the non-conductive.inner ring.1406.. In this manner, if the.housing.1242.is grounded and the conductive.outer ring.1408.contacts the.housing.1242., the conductive.outer ring.1408.may be grounded to the.housing.1242...In contrast to the.crown assemblies.1200.and.1300., the.crown assembly.1400.has an insulator.1410.(e.g., a non-conductive element, layer, or coating) applied to at least one surface of the collar.1208.(e.g., to at least a portion of the surface or surfaces that face an underside of the conductive crown body.1404.). The.insulator.1410.may further prevent the.conductive crown body.1404.from contacting the.collar.1208.when the.crown.1402.is translated toward the.housing.1242.and may provide increased separation resistance between the.collar.1208.and the.crown.210.. In some embodiments, the.insulator.1410.may include a layer of plastic that is overmolded (e.g., LCP overmolded) on at least a portion (or all) of the.collar.1208.that faces the crown.210.(or a plastic element that is placed over or adhered to at least a portion (or all) of the.collar.1208., or a coating that is applied to at least a portion of the collar.1208.). In some embodiments, the plastic may extend to adjacent surfaces of the.housing.206., or into the central opening in the.collar.1208.. In some embodiments, the.insulator.1410.may include a coating (e.g., an electro-deposited (ED) acrylic-based polymer coating). Alternatively or additionally, an insulator (e.g., an element, layer, or coating) may be applied to the underside of the.conductive crown body.1404., or to surfaces of the.shaft.1202.that face the.collar.1208.and/or.housing.206.. Alternatively, the.collar.1208.may be formed from plastic or another material that is non-conductive or otherwise electrically isolates the.conductive crown body.1404.of the.crown.1402., or the.shaft.1202., from other conductive components of the.crown assembly.1500...In any of the.crown assemblies.1200.,.1300.,.1400.described in the present disclosure, the.crown.1204.,.1302., or.1402.may alternately be a monolithic structure and not include additional conductive or non-conductive rings, or may include a single non-conductive (e.g., plastic) ring surrounding a conductive central portion..Turning now to the implementation of an electrode on a button,.FIG. 15.shows an example cross-section of a.button assembly.1500.. The.button assembly.1500.may be an example of a button assembly included in any of the electronic devices described with reference to.FIG. 1A, 1B, 2A-2C, 3, 4A., or.4.B..The.button assembly.1500.may include a.conductive button cap.1502.. The.conductive button cap.1502.may be retained within an opening in a housing by a button cap retention assembly.1504.. The button cap retention assembly.1504., or parts thereof, may be conductive. By way of example, the housing is shown to be the.housing.206.of the.watch body.202.described with reference to.FIGS. 2A-2C, 3, 4A., .4.B. The button cap retention assembly.1504.may be attached to the.housing.206.and extend through the opening in the.housing.206.. In some embodiments, the button cap retention assembly.1504.may include a.first component.1506.that is inserted through the opening from one side of the.housing.206., and a.second component.1508.that fastens to the.first component.1506.on the other side of the housing.206.(e.g., by threads, screws, solder, or an adhesive)..A set of one or more insulators.1510.(e.g., electrical insulators) may electrically insulate the button cap retention assembly.1504.from the.housing.206.. The.insulator.1510.may also electrically insulate the.conductive button cap.1502.from the.housing.206.. Although the.insulator.1510.is generally shown in.FIG. 15.as a singular annular seal around the perimeter of the.button assembly.1500., the.insulator.1510.may alternatively include more than one element or be positioned elsewhere within the.button assembly.1500., as described with reference to.FIGS. 16A, 16B, 17A, 17B, 18A., .18.C..The.conductive button cap.1502.may translate toward and away from the.housing.206., and may be in electrical contact with the button cap retention assembly.1504.during all phases of translation. When the.conductive button cap.1502.is pressed by a user and translates toward the.housing.206., a.tactile switch.1512.may be actuated (e.g., switched between two or more states). A.shaft.1514.may extend from an interior surface of, or be formed integrally with, the.conductive button cap.1502.and a depressible surface of the.tactile switch.1512.. The.tactile switch.1512.and.shaft.1514., or other elements not shown in.FIG. 15.(e.g., springs), may bias the.conductive button cap.1502.in an outwardly translated position..The.conductive button cap.1502.may function as an electrode, and an electrical signal may be routed between the.conductive button cap.1502.and a.circuit.1516., at least in part, via the button cap retention assembly.1504.. In some embodiments, the button cap retention assembly.1504.,.tactile switch.1512., and.circuit.1516.may be attached to a.common substrate.1518...Because the signals received by or propagated from the.conductive button cap.1502.may be low voltage or low amplitude signals, the materials, positions, electrical connections to, and electrical routing paths for an electrode formed on or by the.conductive button cap.1502.can have a significant impact on the ability of the.circuit.1516.to discern useful signals representing an ECG or other biological parameter of a person wearing an electronic device including the.button assembly.1500.. The materials, positions, electrical connections to, and electrical routing paths for the.button assembly.1500.can also determine how well the.button assembly.1500.receives voltages/signals from a person's skin (e.g., a SNR of a device-to-user interface through which the voltages/signals pass); how well voltages/signals are transferred between the.conductive button cap.1502.and internal components of an electronic device (e.g., a voltage/signal propagation SNR); and how well the.button assembly.1500.operates in the face of environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, moisture, electromagnetic radiation, dust, and so on. In some cases, the.insulator.1510.may be positioned to prevent moisture from electrically shorting the.conductive button cap.1502.to the.housing.206., or the.housing.206.may be grounded to provide electrical shielding for some or all of the signals propagated through the.button assembly.1500...More detailed examples of the.button assembly.1500.described with reference to.FIG. 15.are shown in.FIGS. 16A, 16B, 17A, 17B, 18A., .18.B..Turning now to.FIGS. 16A  16B., there is shown an example of a.button assembly.1600.that may be included in any of the electronic devices described with reference to.FIG. 1A, 1B, 2A-2C, 3, 4A., or.4.B..FIG. 16A.shows an exploded view of the.button assembly.1600., and.FIG. 16B.shows an assembled cross-section of the.button assembly.1600., as viewed from the front or rear face of an electronic device such as the.watch body.202.described with reference to.FIGS. 2A-2C, 3, 4A, and 4B...The.button assembly.1600.is an example of the.button assembly.1500.shown in.FIG. 15., and includes components corresponding to the.conductive button cap.1502., button cap retention assembly.1504.,.insulator.1510., and.tactile switch.1512...The.button assembly.1600.may be at least partially within an.opening.1602.in a housing.1604.(e.g., an opening in the housing described with reference to.FIG. 2A, 2C, 3, 4A., or.4.B), and attached to the housing or an internal structure. In some cases, and as shown, the.housing.1604.may include a cavity.1606.(.FIG. 16B.) defined by a.sidewall.1608.and a.ledge.1610.. The.ledge.1610.may surround the.opening.1602., and the.sidewall.1608.may surround the.ledge.1610...The.button assembly.1600.may include a.conductive button cap.1612.. The.conductive button cap.1612.may be retained by a button.cap retention assembly.1614., and may be translatable toward and away from the.housing.1604.. The button.cap retention assembly.1614.may extend through the.opening.1602.and be attached to the.housing.1604.. In some examples, the button.cap retention assembly.1614.may include a.bracket.1616.that overlaps the.ledge.1610.interior to the.housing.1604., and a.retainer.1618.that overlaps the.ledge.1610.exterior to the.housing.1604.. The.retainer.1618.may be mechanically attached to the.bracket.1616.by a set of.screws.1620.or other mechanical fastener. The.screws.1620.may be inserted into through-holes in the.bracket.1616.and screwed into threaded holes in the.retainer.1618., clamping the.ledge.1610.between the.bracket.1616.and the.retainer.1618...The.conductive button cap.1612.may have an.exterior surface.1622., a sidewall or set of sidewalls.1624.parallel to the.sidewall.1608.of the.cavity.1606., and an inward facing lip or set of lips.1626.(.FIG. 16B.) that extends between the.retainer.1618.and the.ledge.1610.and toward a center axis of the.conductive button cap.1612.. A set of one or.more coil springs.1628.or other spring-biased members may be positioned between an outer surface of the.retainer.1618.and an underside of the.conductive button cap.1612., and may bias the.conductive button cap.1612.in an outward state of translation..The button.cap retention assembly.1614., and in particular the.retainer.1618., may have a through-.hole.1629.defined therein, with an axis of the through-.hole.1629.extending perpendicular to the.opening.1602.in the.housing.1604.. A.shaft.1630.may be positioned within the through-.hole.1629., and may translate toward and away from the.housing.1604.. The.shaft.1630.may be mechanically connected to the.conductive button cap.1612., or may be biased to contact the.conductive button cap.1612.. By way of example, the.shaft.1630.may be non-conductive. In a state of rest, the.shaft.1630.and.conductive button cap.1612.may be biased in an outward state of translation (i.e., away from the opening.1602.) by the.coil springs.1628.and/or a spring-biased.tactile switch.1632.. When a user presses the.conductive button cap.1612.toward the.housing.1604., the press may overcome the bias provided by the.coil springs.1628.and/or.tactile switch.1632., and pressure on the.conductive button cap.1612.may be transferred to the.shaft.1630., which translates toward the.housing.1604.and presses on the.tactile switch.1632.to change the state of the tactile switch.1632.(e.g., from ON to OFF or vice versa, from one functional state to another, etc.). The.tactile switch.1632.may be aligned with an axis of the.shaft.1630.and attached to the.bracket.1616.using an adhesive.1634.(e.g., a conductive PSA)..In some embodiments, a gasket.1636.(e.g., an O-ring) may be positioned between the.shaft.1630.and the through-hole. The.shaft.1630.may have a.circumferential groove.1638.in which a portion of the.gasket.1636.is seated so that the.gasket.1636.moves in a predictable way in response to movement of the.shaft.1630.. In some examples, the.gasket.1636.may be non-conductive..The.button assembly.1600.may further include a set of electrical insulators (i.e., one or more electrical insulators), which set of electrical insulators may electrically insulate the button.cap retention assembly.1614.from the.housing.1604., and electrically insulate the.conductive button cap.1612.from the.housing.1604.. For example, the.button assembly.1600.may include a first electrical insulator, such as a sleeve.1640.(or set of shims), positioned between the.conductive button cap.1612.and the sidewall.1608.(or set of sidewalls) of the.cavity.1606.in the.housing.1604.. In some cases, the.sleeve.1640.may include a closed-shape sidewall and an inward facing lip.1642.(.FIG. 16B.). In other cases, the.sleeve.1640.may not include the.inward facing lip.1642.or have a sidewall that does not define a closed shape. In other cases, the first electrical insulator may be a planar perimeter gasket (e.g., an insulator including the.lip.1642.but not the sidewall).

The materials, positions, electrical connections to, and electrical routing paths for the.button assembly.1900.can also determine how well the.button assembly.1900.receives voltages/signals from a person's skin (e.g., a SNR of a device-to-user interface through which the voltages/signals pass); how well voltages/signals are transferred between the.conductive button cap.1902.and internal components of an electronic device (e.g., a voltage/signal propagation SNR); and how well the.button assembly.1900.operates in the face of environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, moisture, electromagnetic radiation, dust, and so on. In some cases, the.insulator.1910.may be positioned to prevent moisture from electrically shorting the.conductive button cap.1902.to the.housing.206., or the.housing.206.may be grounded to provide electrical shielding for some or all of the signals propagated through the.button assembly.1900...More detailed examples of the.button assembly.1900.described with reference to.FIG. 19.are shown in.FIGS. 20, 21., .22...Referring now to.FIG. 20., there is shown an assembled cross-section of another example of a.button assembly.2000.that may be included in any of the electronic devices described with reference to.FIG. 1A, 1B, 2A-2C, 3, 4A., or.4.B.

For example, the.processor.2510.can be a microprocessor, a central processing unit (CPU), an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a digital signal processor (DSP), or combinations of such devices. As described herein, the term processor is meant to encompass a single processor or processing unit, multiple processors, multiple processing units, or other suitably configured computing element or elements..It should be noted that the components of the electronic device.2500.can be controlled by multiple processors. For example, select components of the electronic device.2500.(e.g., a sensor.2525.) may be controlled by a first processor and other components of the electronic device.2500.(e.g., the display.2505.) may be controlled by a second processor, where the first and second processors may or may not be in communication with each other. In some cases, the.processor.2510.may determine a biological parameter of a user of the electronic device, such as an ECG for the user..The.power source.2515.can be implemented with any device capable of providing energy to the electronic device.2500.. For example, the.power source.2515.may be one or more batteries or rechargeable batteries. Additionally or alternatively, the.power source.2515.can be a power connector or power cord that connects the electronic device.2500.to another power source, such as a wall outlet..The.memory.2520.can store electronic data that can be used by the electronic device.2500.. For example, the.memory.2520.can store electrical data or content such as, for example, audio and video files, documents and applications, device settings and user preferences, timing signals, control signals, and data structures or databases. The.memory.2520.can be configured as any type of memory. By way of example only, the.memory.2520.can be implemented as random access memory, read-only memory, Flash memory, removable memory, other types of storage elements, or combinations of such devices..The electronic device.2500.may also include one or.more sensors.2525.positioned almost anywhere on the electronic device.2500.. The sensor(s).2525.can be configured to sense one or more type of parameters, such as but not limited to, pressure, light, touch, heat, movement, relative motion, biometric data (e.g., biological parameters), and so on. For example, the sensor(s).2525.may include a heat sensor, a position sensor, a light or optical sensor, an accelerometer, a pressure transducer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, a health monitoring sensor, and so on. Additionally, the one or.more sensors.2525.can utilize any suitable sensing technology, including, but not limited to, capacitive, ultrasonic, resistive, optical, ultrasound, piezoelectric, and thermal sensing technology. In some examples, the.sensors.2525.may include one or more of the electrodes described herein (e.g., one or more electrodes on an exterior surface of a carrier that forms part of a housing for the electronic device.2500.and/or an electrode on a crown, button, or other housing member of the electronic device)..The I/.O mechanism.2530.can transmit and/or receive data from a user or another electronic device. An I/O device can include a display, a touch sensing input surface, one or more buttons (e.g., a graphical user interface home button), one or more cameras, one or more microphones or speakers, one or more ports such as a microphone port, and/or a keyboard. Additionally or alternatively, an I/O device or port can transmit electronic signals via a communications network, such as a wireless and/or wired network connection. Examples of wireless and wired network connections include, but are not limited to, cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, IR, and Ethernet connections..As discussed above, graphics displayed on the electronic devices herein may be manipulated through inputs provided to the crown..FIGS. 26A-28B.generally depict examples of changing a graphical output displayed on an electronic device through inputs provided by force and/or rotational inputs to a crown assembly of the device. This manipulation (e.g., selection, acknowledgement, motion, dismissal, magnification, and so on) of a graphic may result in changes in operation of the electronic device and/or graphical output displayed by the electronic device. Although specific examples are provided and discussed, many operations may be performed by rotating and/or applying force to a crown such as the examples described above. Accordingly, the following discussion is by way of example and not limitation..FIG. 26A.depicts an example electronic device.2600.(shown here as an electronic watch) having a.crown.2602.. The.crown.2602.may be similar to the examples described above, and may receive force inputs along a first lateral direction, a second lateral direction, or an axial direction of the crown. The.crown.2602.may also receive rotational inputs. A.display.2606.provides a graphical output (e.g., shows information and/or other graphics). In some embodiments, the.display.2606.may be configured as a touch-sensitive display capable of receiving touch and/or force input. In the current example, the.display.2606.depicts a list of.various items.2661.,.2662.,.2663., all of which are example graphics..FIG. 26B.illustrates how the graphical output shown on the.display.2606.changes in a first manner as the.crown.2602.rotates, partially or completely (as indicated by the arrow.2660.). Rotating the.crown.2602.causes the list to scroll or otherwise move on the screen, such that the.first item.2661.is no longer displayed, the second and.third items.2662.,.2663.each move upwards on the display, and a.fourth item.2664.is now shown at the bottom of the display. This is one example of a scrolling operation that can be executed by rotating the.crown.2602.. Such scrolling operations may provide a simple and efficient way to depict multiple items relatively quickly and in sequential order. A speed of the scrolling operation may be controlled by the amount of rotational force applied to the.crown.2602.and/or the speed at which the.crown.2602.is rotated. Faster or more forceful rotation may yield faster scrolling, while slower or less forceful rotation yields slower scrolling. The.crown.2602.may receive an axial force (e.g., a force inward toward the.display.2606.or watch body) to select an item from the list, in certain embodiments..FIGS. 27A and 27B.illustrate an example zoom operation. The.display.2706.depicts a.picture.2766.at a first magnification, shown in.FIG. 27A.; the.picture.2766.is yet another example of a graphic. A user may apply a translating force (e.g., a force along the z-axis) or a lateral force (e.g., a force along the x-axis) to the.crown.2702.of the electronic device.2700.(illustrated by arrow.2765.), and in response the display may change a graphic in a second manner, such as zooming into the.picture.2766.so that a.portion.2767.of the picture is shown at an increased magnification. This is shown in.FIG. 27B.. The direction of zoom (in vs. out) and speed of zoom, or location of zoom, may be controlled through force applied to the.crown.2702., and particularly through the direction of applied force and/or magnitude of applied force. Applying force to the.crown.2702.in a first direction may zoom in, while applying force to the.crown.2702.in an opposite direction may zoom out. Alternately, rotating or applying force to the.crown.2702.in a first direction may change the portion of the picture subject to the zoom effect. In some embodiments, applying an axial or translating force (e.g., a force along the z-axis) to the.crown.2702.may toggle between different zoom modes or inputs (e.g., direction of zoom vs. portion of picture subject to zoom), or otherwise change the displayed graphic in a second manner. In yet other embodiments, applying force to the.crown.2702.along another direction, such as along the y-axis, may return the.picture.2766.to the default magnification shown in.FIG. 27A...FIGS. 28A and 28B.illustrate possible use of the.crown.2802.to change an operational state of the.electronic device.2800.or otherwise toggle between inputs. Turning first to.FIG. 28A., the.display.2806.depicts a.question.2868., namely, Would you like directions? As shown in.FIG. 28B., a lateral force may be applied to the crown.2802.(illustrated by arrow.2870.) to answer the question. Applying force to the.crown.2802.provides an input interpreted by the.electronic device.2800.as yes, and so YES is displayed as a graphic.2869.on the.display.2806.. Applying force to the.crown.2802.in an opposite direction may provide a no input. Both the.question.2868.and graphic.2869.are examples of graphics..In the embodiment shown in.FIGS. 28A and 28B., the force applied to the.crown.2802.is used to directly provide the input, rather than select from options in a list (as discussed above with respect to.FIGS. 26A and 26B.)..As mentioned previously, force or rotational input to a crown of an electronic device may control many functions beyond those listed here. The crown may receive distinct force or rotational inputs to adjust a volume of an electronic device, a brightness of a display, or other operational parameters of the device. A force or rotational input applied to the crown may rotate to turn a display on or off, or turn the device on or off. A force or rotational input to the crown may launch or terminate an application on the electronic device. Further, combinations of inputs to the crown may likewise initiate or control any of the foregoing functions, as well..In some cases, the graphical output of a display may be responsive to inputs applied to a touch-sensitive display (e.g., displays.2606.,.2706.,.2806., and the like) in addition to inputs applied to a crown. The touch-sensitive display may include or be associated with one or more touch and/or force sensors that extend along an output region of a display and which may use any suitable sensing elements and/or sensing techniques to detect touch and/or force inputs applied to the touch-sensitive display. The same or similar graphical output manipulations that are produced in response to inputs applied to the crown may also be produced in response to inputs applied to the touch-sensitive display. For example, a swipe gesture applied to the touch-sensitive display may cause the graphical output to move in a direction corresponding to the swipe gesture. As another example, a tap gesture applied to the touch-sensitive display may cause an item to be selected or activated. In this way, a user may have multiple different ways to interact with and control an electronic watch, and in particular the graphical output of an electronic watch. Further, while the crown may provide overlapping functionality with the touch-sensitive display, using the crown allows for the graphical output of the display to be visible (without being blocked by the finger that is providing the touch input)..As another example, and of the inputs described in.FIGS. 26A-28B.may be used to select, initiate, or display an ECG, or otherwise begin the operation of determining an ECG or launching an ECG application..As described above, one aspect of the present technology is the gathering and use of data available from various sources, including the gathering and use of biological parameters of a user, to monitor or improve the user's health or fitness. The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, this gathered data may include personal information data that uniquely identifies a specific person, or can be used to contact, locate, or identify a specific person. Such personal information data can include demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, twitter IDs, home addresses, data or records relating to a user's health or level of fitness (e.g., vital sign measurements, medication information, exercise information), date of birth, or any other identifying or personal information..The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information data, in the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. For example, the personal information data can be used to aid a user in monitoring or improving their health or fitness (e.g., biological parameters or health and fitness data may be used to provide insights into a user's general wellness, or may be used as positive feedback to individuals using technology to pursue wellness goals)..The present disclosure contemplates that the entities responsible for the collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal information data will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy practices. In particular, such entities should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining personal information data private and secure. Such policies should be easily accessible by users, and should be updated as the collection and/or use of data changes. Personal information from users should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection/sharing should occur after receiving the informed consent of the users. Additionally, such entities should consider taking any needed steps for safeguarding and securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to the personal information data adhere to their privacy policies and procedures. Further, such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices. In addition, policies and practices should be adapted for the particular types of personal information data being collected and/or accessed and adapted to applicable laws and standards, including jurisdiction-specific considerations. For instance, in the US, collection of or access to certain health data may be governed by federal and/or state laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); whereas health data in other countries may be subject to other regulations and policies and should be handled accordingly. Hence different privacy practices should be maintained for different personal data types in each country..Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is, the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided to prevent or block access to such personal information data. For example, in the case of biological parameters or conditions identified therefrom, the present technology can be configured to allow users to select to opt in or opt out of participation in the collection of personal information data during registration for services or anytime thereafter. In another example, users can select not to provide health or fitness-associated data to the providers of applications or services, or can prevent the transmission of such data from the device on which it is collected or outside a collection of devices that are personal to a user from which the data is obtained. In yet another example, a user can select to limit the length of time health or fitness data, or biological parameters from which such data is derived, is maintained. In addition to providing opt in and opt out options, the present disclosure contemplates providing notifications relating to the access or use of personal information. For instance, a user may be notified upon downloading an app that their personal information data will be accessed and then reminded again just before personal information data is accessed by the app..Moreover, it is the intent of the present disclosure that personal information data should be managed and handled in a way to minimize risks of unintentional or unauthorized access or use. Risk can be minimized by limiting the collection of data and deleting data once it is no longer needed. In addition, and when applicable, including in certain health related applications, data de-identification can be used to protect a user's privacy. De-identification may be facilitated, when appropriate, by removing specific identifiers (e.g., date of birth, etc.), controlling the amount or specificity of data stored (e.g., collecting location data at a city level rather than at an address level), controlling how data is stored (e.g., aggregating data across users), and/or other methods..Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal information data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the need for accessing at least some personal information data. That is, the various embodiments of the present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of a portion of such personal information data. For example, biological parameters can be ascertained or stored without associating the biological parameters with information identifying a particular user from which they are obtained, or with a bare minimum amount of personal information, such as non-personal information already available to service providers or publicly available information..The foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, uses specific nomenclature to provide a thorough understanding of the described embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the specific details are not required in order to practice the described embodiments. Thus, the foregoing descriptions of the specific embodiments described herein are presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not targeted to be exhaustive or to limit the embodiments to the precise forms disclosed. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings."
