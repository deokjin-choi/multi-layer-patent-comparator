Dish Washer.Dish Washer Dish Washer.     ,                  ..The present invention relates to a dishwasher, and more particularly, to a dishwasher capable of improving washing efficiency by improving a spray arm structure of the dishwasher..       (, )       ..A dishwasher is a device that cleans dirt, such as food residue, from dishes or cooking utensils (hereinafter referred to as 'washing target') by using detergent and washing water..    ,      (dish rack),     ,   ,          ..A dishwasher includes a washing tank providing a washing space, a dish rack provided in the washing tank and accommodating objects to be washed, a spray arm spraying washing water into the rack, a sump storing washing water, and supplying the washing water stored in the sump to the spray arm. It is common to include a supply flow path..               .                         (rolling : )            ..In general, a dishwasher cleans dishes by evenly spraying washing water on a washing target by rotating a spray arm that sprays the washing water. Recently, when the spray arm that sprays washing water rotates, the rotational force of the spray arm is used to reciprocate (rolling) along the arcuate trajectory of the spray arm according to the rotation of the spray arm to separate the spray arm from spraying the washing water. A dishwasher in which an auxiliary arm for spraying is additionally provided to improve washing power is being developed..     10-2012-0126598      .      ,            ..Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2012-0126598, which is a prior document, discloses the idea of such a dishwasher. The dishwasher disclosed in the prior literature has a structure in which washing water is sprayed upward through a nozzle of a spray arm accommodated inside the washing tub..,             .      .           ,         ..Meanwhile, when the washing water is sprayed on a dish to be washed, it is necessary to spray the washing water evenly on the surface of the dish. Therefore, it is necessary to spray the washing water from various angles. In the case of a conventional dishwasher, the rotation of the spray arm rotates the spray nozzle, but it is necessary to diversify the spray angle for more efficient cleaning..                             ..An object of the present invention is to provide a dishwasher capable of improving the structure of a spray arm of the dishwasher so as to increase a spray area and washing efficiency of washing water sprayed by the spray arm..,                         ..Another object of the present invention is to provide a dishwasher capable of rotating a spray arm using thrust generated by spraying washing water without a separate driving device..,                                   ..In addition, a problem to be solved by the present invention is a dishwasher having a main arm constituting a spray arm and an auxiliary arm rotatably mounted to the main arm so that the spray angle of the auxiliary arm can be varied according to the rotation of the spray arm. Its purpose is to provide.,                              ..In addition, an object to be solved by the present invention is to provide a main arm constituting a spray arm and an auxiliary arm rotatably mounted to the main arm to reciprocate the auxiliary arm using rotational force of the main arm..,                          ,             ..In addition, the problem to be solved by the present invention is provided with a main arm constituting a spray arm and an auxiliary arm rotatably mounted to the main arm, so that the rotation of the main arm is constrained to the rotation of the auxiliary arm, but the auxiliary arm is not rotatable. The purpose of the main arm is to make it rotatable..       ,                ..The tasks of the present invention are not limited to the tasks mentioned above, and other tasks not mentioned are intended to be clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the following description..             ,     ,           ,                                          ..In order to achieve the above object, the dishwasher according to the present invention has a spray arm for spraying washing water on a washing object, a fixed gear unit having gear teeth formed on the outer circumferential surface, and a rotation of the spray arm that engages with the gear of the fixed gear unit to rotate It includes an eccentric gear unit, a link member connected to the eccentric gear unit and the spray arm, and the spray arm includes a main arm including a pair of arms and a pair of auxiliary arms rotatably provided on the main arm, and a link member.

It is formed to have different injection areas. Therefore, when the same first.auxiliary arm.400a (or second.auxiliary arm.400b) is installed in the first and second auxiliary.arm connection parts.330a and 330b, the installed first.auxiliary arm.400a (or second.auxiliary arm.400b) Since the.arm.400b has the same spraying area, cleaning efficiency may be reduced..  1, 2 (400a, 400b)     ()    .

To this end, the number of.first gears.512 of the fixed.gear unit.500 and the number of.second gears.812 of the.eccentric gear unit.800 may be formed in a relative prime relationship. When the number of.first gears.512 of the fixed.gear unit.500 and the number of.second gears.812 of the.eccentric gear unit.800 are mutually correlated, the fixed.gear unit.500 and the eccentric gear unit The rotation pattern period of 800 is much longer than the drainage relationship of the first and.second gears.512 and 812, so that the spray patterns of the washing water sprayed by the first and second.auxiliary arms.400a and 400b can vary..,  (800)  2(812)   (500)  1(512)     ,  1(512)    2(812)      .   2(812)        (812a)    ..On the other hand, in the case of the.second gear.812 of the.eccentric gear unit.800, it has a relatively smaller diameter than the.first gear.512 of the fixed.gear unit.500, and is controlled by friction with the.first gear.512. An undercut phenomenon may occur in the.second gear.812 . Therefore, in the case of the.second gear.812, an under.cut groove.812a may be further formed to prevent wear due to friction..,  1(512)   (500)  2(812)   (800)             ..In addition, when the fixed.gear unit.500 in which the.first gear teeth.512 are formed and the.eccentric gear unit.800 in which the.second gear teeth.812 are formed are made of the same material, the same wear due to mutual friction may occur. there is..

The rotation.shaft support protrusions.820 are elastically deformed into the space L5 since a gap L5 is formed between each rotation.shaft support protrusion.820 . Therefore, when a foreign substance is caught between the.second gear.812 of the.eccentric gear unit.800 and the.first gear.512 of the fixed.gear unit.500, the volume of the foreign material is applied to the.rim portion.810 of the.eccentric gear unit.800. External force is applied and the rotating.shaft support protrusion.820 inside the.rim part.810 is elastically deformed, so that the.eccentric gear part.800 can be rotated along the fixed.gear part.500 regardless of foreign substances caught in the first and second gears. ..,       (100)  (900)      ..Hereinafter, the.link member.900 of the.spray arm assembly.100 according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.. 32        ,  33        ,  34  32 E'-E\"  ..Figure 32 is a perspective view showing a link member according to an embodiment of the present invention, Figure 33 is a rear view showing a link member according to an embodiment of the present invention, Figure 34 is a line E'-E \"of FIG. cross section shown.. 32  34     (900)    (340)    (356)        (910),  (910)  1 (300a)     1 (920a),  (910)  2 (300b)      (800)   2 (920b),  1(300c)   1 (400a)   1 (950a),   2(300d)   2 (400b)   2 (950b) ..As shown in FIGS. 32 to 34, the.link member.900 has a rim-shaped.body.910 having a long hole-shaped hole into which the injection arm.holder coupling part.356 of the main arm.lower housing.340 is movably inserted. , The first.main link.920a extending from the rim-shaped.body.910 to the side of the first.main arm.300a and movably coupled thereto, and extending from the rim-shaped.body.910 to the side of the second.main arm.300b to be movable A second.main link.920b coupled to and connected to the.eccentric gear unit.800, and a first.auxiliary link.950a extending toward the.first extension part.300c and connected to the first.auxiliary arm.400a, A second.auxiliary link.950b extending toward the.second extension part.300d and connected to the second.auxiliary arm.400b is included..,  (910)     (356)    (600)   (900)       (356)     (900)    (911) .
