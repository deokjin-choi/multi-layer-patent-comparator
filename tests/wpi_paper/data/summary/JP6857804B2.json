  "problem": "Contact variation and wear between water droplet removing portion and back surface of tray, as well as dirt accumulation under washing tank due to non-washing of water tray in conventional dishwashers.",
  "solution_function": "The dishwasher of the present invention includes a main tray and an auxiliary tray, where the main tray is washed during the washing process and receives dirt that falls from dishes. The auxiliary tray is positioned below the main tray and outside the washing space to catch water droplets that adhere to the back surface of the main tray, preventing them from falling on the floor surface. This design prevents contact variation and wear between water droplet removing portion and back surface of tray, as well as reducing dirt accumulation under the washing tank.",
  "solution_structure": "The dishwasher consists of a washing tank with a front opening, a door body that can be pulled out forward to access the washing tank. Inside the washing space formed by the door body is a tableware basket, cleaning nozzle, and main tray (washed during the washing process). Below the main tray is an auxiliary tray. The water pan is provided below the dishwasher and extends rearward like a cantilever during the washing process.",
  "solution_implementation": "During the washing process, dishes are placed in the tableware basket within the washing space. Water and detergent are sprayed through the cleaning nozzle onto the dishes. The dirt falls from the dishes to the main tray, which is washed during this process. Any water droplets adhering to the back surface of the main tray are caught by the auxiliary tray positioned below it.",
  "effect": "The design results in a hygienic dishwasher where water droplets do not fall on the floor surface and dirt does not accumulate under the washing tank, improving the overall cleanliness of the dishwasher.",
