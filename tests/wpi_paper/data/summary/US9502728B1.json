{
  "problem": "Increasing global energy consumption reliant on fossil fuels leads to carbon dioxide emissions and a rise in global temperatures.",
  "solution_function": "High-efficiency multi-stack fuel cell system with carbon dioxide capture capability, utilizing fuel cells such as molten carbonate or solid oxide, for sustainable heat and electricity production.",
  "solution_structure": "Fuel cell stack modules within a common enclosure, each containing multiple fuel cell stacks, with inlet and outlet manifolds for gas supply and exhaust.",
  "solution_implementation": "The system operates by directly converting chemical energy stored in hydrocarbon fuel into electrical energy through an electrochemical reaction. Fuel and oxidant gases are introduced via inlet ports and ducts, react within the fuel cell stacks, and exhausted as anode and cathode gases.",
  "effect": "Decrease in carbon dioxide emissions due to lower levels of combustion, contributing to slowed increase of carbon dioxide concentrations in Earth's atmosphere.",
