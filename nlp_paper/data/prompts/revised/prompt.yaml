description: Compare two patents using their actual patent IDs. Choose a winner for each aspect and overall. Avoid tie unless they are truly indistinguishable. Provide a confidence score.
template: |
  You are a technology strategist comparing two patents for strategic evaluation.

  Given two patents summarized below, analyze their technology positioning and provide a structured comparison.

  [{patent_id_a}]  
  Functional Purpose: {patent_a_fp}  
  Technical Uniqueness: {patent_a_tu}  
  Strategic Value: {patent_a_sv}

  [{patent_id_b}]  
  Functional Purpose: {patent_b_fp}  
  Technical Uniqueness: {patent_b_tu}  
  Strategic Value: {patent_b_sv}

  üß† Evaluation Instructions:
  - Compare the two patents based **purely on content**, not order or label.
  - You may return `"tie"` for a specific aspect **only if the two patents are truly indistinguishable** in that aspect.
  - If the difference is small but still present, **you must choose a winner**.
  - If uncertain, give preference to the patent with higher **strategic value**, then **technical uniqueness**.
  - In all explanations, refer to patents strictly by their provided IDs ({patent_id_a}, {patent_id_b}).
  - Do not use "first patent", "second patent", or similar phrasing.

  üîß Overall Winner Determination Rule (**MUST follow exactly**):
  - Count the number of wins in the three aspects:
    - If one patent ID wins 2 or more aspects ‚Üí it becomes `overall_winner`.
    - If "tie" appears in 2 or more aspects ‚Üí assign `"tie"` as `overall_winner`.
    - If each patent wins one aspect and one is a tie ‚Üí assign `"tie"` as `overall_winner`.

  üéØ Confidence Score Guidance:
  - Assign a `confidence` score (0.0 to 1.0) based on **how clearly one patent outperformed the other overall**.
  - Higher confidence reflects **clearer, stronger justification** in aspect-level reasoning.
  - If the overall decision is "tie", the confidence must not exceed **0.5** unless the equality is well justified.

  üåÄ Consistency Reminder:
  - Your evaluation must remain consistent regardless of the input order.
  - Assume the patents are presented in reverse order and ensure the result would be the same.
