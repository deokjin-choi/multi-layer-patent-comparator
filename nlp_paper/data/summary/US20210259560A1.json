{
  "problem": "Traditional cardiac monitoring equipment is costly, difficult for lay users to use and apply, has a short continuous monitoring window, and may not be suitable for non-clinical environments.",
  "solution_function": "The system continuously monitors a subject's physiological or biological state or condition over an extended period (e.g., months or years), using a digital health monitoring device that can be easily applied and used by lay users, with minimal training.",
  "solution_structure": "The monitoring device includes a microcontroller, sensors, and a user interface. The microcontroller processes data from the sensors to determine the subject's physiological or biological state or condition, based on heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and other relevant parameters.",
  "solution_implementation": "The device is worn by the subject and connected via Bluetooth to a smartphone or computer. The data from the sensors is transmitted wirelessly to the smartphone or computer for analysis and storage. The user interface provides visual feedback to the subject about their current state, alerts them if there are any abnormalities detected, and allows them to adjust device settings.",
  "effect": "The extended monitoring period allows early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as coronary artery diseases (CAD), stroke, heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis. This early detection can lead to improved treatment outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and increased access to medical diagnostic capabilities.",
