  "problem": "Inefficient performance in computations associated with dimensional arrays of data (vectors) for technology fields such as numerical simulations, graphics processing, gaming console design, supercomputing, and machine learning computations for Deep Neural Networks (DNN) layers due to limitations in conventional vector processing units",
  "solution_function": "Performs vectorized computations for a multi-dimensional data array using a partitioned system consisting of an SIMD VPU with increased flexibility and memory bandwidth requirements, a matrix unit (MXU) with lower flexibility and high computational density, and a low memory-bandwidth cross-lane unit (XU) for certain operations. The system tightly couples the processor units and vector memory within the VPU for high bandwidth data communication.",
  "solution_structure": "Includes one or more processor units performing arithmetic operations associated with vectorized computations, a vector memory in data communication with each processor unit (including memory banks), and optionally a matrix operation unit, first data serializer, and second data serializer for serializing output data.",
  "solution_implementation": "The SIMD VPU and MXU perform vectorized computations using the tightly coupled processor units and vector memory. The MXU receives at least two operands from a particular processor unit for operations associated with the multi-dimensional data array, and the first/second data serializer serialize output data provided by the particular processor unit as required.",
  "effect": "Enhanced SIMD processor design architecture relative to current/conventional SIMD processors, potentially resulting in improved performance, resource utilization, or flexibility for certain computations associated with dimensional arrays of data.",
