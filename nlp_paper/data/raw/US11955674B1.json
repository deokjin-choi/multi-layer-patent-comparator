In the petrochemical industry, an exemplary use of furnaces is in a hydrocarbon cracking system to produce an olefin from an alkane, such as ethylene from ethane. The heat in a furnace can be supplied by the combustion of a fuel gas that can contain hydrocarbons, and combustion of hydrocarbons in the furnace can produce a flue gas that contains carbon dioxide and water..In an effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions for these types of furnaces, the flue gas emitted from a furnace can be introduced to a carbon capture process, in which carbon dioxide is removed from the flue gas to produce a carbon dioxide product having a high concentration of carbon dioxide and a residual gas product that has a low concentration of carbon dioxide. The residual gas product can then be used or processed accordingly with reduced concern for carbon dioxide emissions..There is a need to find other techniques to reduce carbon emissions from hydrocarbon cracking systems..SUMMARY.Described herein is a process that includes: separating a first cracking product stream into a hydrogen-rich methane stream and one or more second cracking product streams; introducing the hydrogen-rich methane stream or a derivative product stream to an anode chamber of a fuel cell; introducing an oxygen-containing stream to a cathode chamber of the fuel cell, wherein the fuel cell has an assembly including an anode and a cathode that are separated by a separating element (e.g., a solid oxide element or a molten carbonate element); and converting, at the anode of the fuel cell, methane and hydrogen received from the hydrogen-rich methane stream or from the methane product stream to carbon dioxide and water to generate electricity..Also described herein is a hydrocarbon cracking system that includes: a furnace having a conduit contained in an interior of the furnace; a first separator fluidly connected to an outlet of the conduit and configured to separate a first cracking product stream into a hydrogen-rich methane stream and one or more second cracking product streams; a second separator fluidly connected to the first separator and configured to separate the hydrogen-rich methane stream into a hydrogen product stream and a methane product stream; a fuel cell having an anode chamber, a cathode chamber, and an assembly including i) an anode, ii) a cathode, and iii) a separating element (e.g., a solid oxide element or a molten carbonate element) positioned between the anode and the cathode, wherein an inlet to the anode chamber is configured to receive the methane product stream, wherein the fuel cell is configured to convert, at the anode of the fuel cell, methane and hydrogen received from the methane product stream or a derivative product stream to carbon dioxide and water to generate electricity..Also described herein is another hydrocarbon cracking system that includes: a furnace having a conduit contained in an interior of the furnace; a first separator fluidly connected to an outlet of the conduit and configured to separate a first cracking product stream into a hydrogen-rich methane stream and a second cracking product stream; a fuel cell having an anode chamber, a cathode chamber, and an assembly including i) an anode, ii) a cathode, and iii) a separating element (e.g., a solid oxide element or a molten carbonate element) positioned between the anode and the cathode, wherein an inlet to the anode chamber is configured to receive the hydrogen-rich methane stream, wherein the fuel cell is configured to convert, at the anode of the fuel cell, methane and hydrogen received from the hydrogen-rich methane stream or a derivative product stream to carbon dioxide and water to generate electricity..Other technical features may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions and claims..BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS.For a more complete understanding of this disclosure, reference is now made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:.FIG..1.illustrates a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a hydrocarbon cracking system..FIG..2.illustrates a schematic diagram of another embodiment of the hydrocarbon cracking system..FIG..3.illustrates a schematic diagram of another embodiment of the hydrocarbon cracking system..FIG..4.illustrates a schematic diagram of another embodiment of the hydrocarbon cracking system..FIG..5.A.illustrates a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the carbon capture process..FIG..5.B.illustrates a schematic diagram of another embodiment of the carbon capture process..DETAILED DESCRIPTION.Illustrative aspects of the subject matter claimed herein will now be disclosed. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It can be appreciated that in the development of any such actual aspect, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which can vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it can be appreciated that such a development effort, even if complex and time-consuming, would be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure..As used herein, any recited ranges of values contemplate all values within the range including the end points of the range, and are to be construed as support for claims reciting any sub-ranges having endpoints within the recited range. By way of example, a disclosure in this specification of a range of from 10 to 15 shall be considered to support claims to values of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, and to any of the following ranges: 10-11, 10-12, 10-13, 10-14, 10-15, 11-12, 11-13, 11-14, 11-15, 12-13; 12-14, 12-15, 13-14, 13-15, and 14-15..The term stream as used herein refers to a composition of the components disclosed herein for the respective stream. The term stream can additionally refer to and imply associated equipment, such as conduit, line, and pipe that is used to move the composition from one location to another (e.g., a stream from one equipment unit to another equipment unit)..The term conduit as used herein refers to a tubular structure through which a fluid can flow and having a wall thickness rated for the fluid pressure. A conduit can be embodied as a pipe or tube, for example. Additionally, conduit may refer to a segment of pipe or tubes, or to a series or string of pipes or tubes..The term derivative product stream as used herein refers to a stream that is derived from the hydrogen-rich methane stream disclosed herein, where derived means that any number and type of process steps can occur to obtain the derivative product stream from the hydrogen-rich methane stream. Examples of derivative product streams disclosed herein are the methane product stream, the recycle stream, and the reformer product stream..A hydrocarbon cracking system produces a cracking product, and the cracking product can be separated to recover valuable hydrocarbons. In the separation, a tail gas containing hydrogen and methane can be formed, and the tail gas can be fed to the furnace of the hydrocarbon cracking system as fuel. Feeding the tail gas back to the furnace in the cracking system results in combustion of the methane, which converts the methane to carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide exits from the furnace as part of the flue gas of the furnace. While the flue gas emitted from a furnace can be treated to capture carbon dioxide, it has been found that the presence of hydrogen in the tail gas, when used as at least a portion of the fuel for the furnace of the hydrocarbon cracking system, can reduce the concentration of the carbon dioxide in the flue gas that is treated to capture carbon dioxide. The presence of hydrogen, hydrogen combustion products, and reduced amount of methane in the flue gas presents a challenge for carbon capture techniques that are performed on the flue gas..The disclosed processes and systems treat the tail gas of the hydrocarbon cracking system. The disclosed processes and systems utilize a fuel cell having an assembly that converts methane to carbon dioxide and hydrogen to water, while generating electricity that can be used to power equipment. In aspects, the carbon dioxide and water produced by the fuel cell can be subject to carbon capture to produce a CO2 product that can be stored, used in a process, transported by pipeline, or sequestered. In the context of a hydrocarbon cracking system, the disclosed processes and systems shift at least part of the carbon capture away from the flue gas and to the tail gas of the hydrocarbon cracking system. Moreover, the disclosed processes and systems provide aspects of sustainability because the electricity generated by the fuel cell can be used to power equipment. In some aspects, the electricity generated can provide incentive to convert fossil-fuel powered equipment to be powered by electric motors (e.g., pumps, compressors) or electric heaters (e.g., electric heaters for a reactor or furnace). Moreover still, the streams treated herein have low levels of nitrogen, or no nitrogen, which avoids formation of NOx compounds in the fuel cell and avoids the need for nitrogen removal equipment to avoid or address formation of NOx compounds in the fuel cell..The following description refers to treatment of a hydrogen-rich methane stream, which in some aspects, can be embodied as the tail gas of a hydrocarbon cracking system.
