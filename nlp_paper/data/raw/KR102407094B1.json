APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MEASURING BIO-INFORMATION.Apparatus and method for measuring biometric information APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MEASURING BIO-INFORMATION.      ,        ..The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for measuring biometric information, and more particularly, to a technology for measuring blood pressure without a cuff worn on a wrist..     (non-invasive)   ,                 ..In general, as a method of measuring blood pressure non-invasively without inflicting damage to the human body, there are a method of measuring blood pressure by measuring cuff-based pressure itself and a method of estimating blood pressure through pulse wave measurement without a cuff. ..

(upper arm) (cuff)               ,                     .As a cuff-based blood pressure measurement method, there are a Korotkoff-sound method and an oscillometric method. The Korotkoff sound method is a method of measuring blood pressure by listening to sounds from blood vessels through a stethoscope while increasing and decreasing the intra-cuff pressure by wrapping a cuff around the upper arm. Blood pressure may be measured differently depending on the measurer because the sense of the time of hearing the auscultation sound may be different for each measurer..                               .                        . ,          ..The oscillometric method uses an automated machine. After winding the cuff around the upper arm, increasing the cuff pressure, and gradually decreasing the cuff pressure, the intra-cuff pressure is continuously measured, and then the blood pressure is measured based on the point where the pressure signal changes greatly. way to do it Since the oscillometric method requires a strong pressure to be applied to the cuff, repeated measurements may cause damage to blood vessels or tissues for patients with high blood pressure or the elderly with low tissue elasticity. In addition, most of the equipment is bulky, so it is difficult for an individual to carry and measure..     (PTT, pulse transit time)    ,      PWA(Pulse Wave Analysis)  .              ..In general, cuffless blood pressure measurement methods include a method of estimating blood pressure by calculating a pulse transit time (PTT) and a pulse wave analysis (PWA) method of estimating blood pressure by analyzing a shape of a pulse wave. Since the pulse wave transmission time or shape of the pulse wave is caused by various factors other than changes in blood pressure, accuracy is limited..  10-2017-0067131(2017.06.15.).Republic of Korea Patent Publication No. 10-2017-0067131 (2017.06.15.).                 ..A wrist-worn biometric information measuring device and method for measuring biometric information such as blood pressure through a change in hand shape without a cuff are presented..  ,      ,             ,                        ..According to one aspect, the biometric information measuring device includes a main body worn on the subject, a contact pressure sensor mounted on the main body and measuring a contact pressure of the subject while a hand shape is changed, and a pulse wave signal mounted on the main body and measuring a pulse wave signal of the subject It may include a pulse wave sensor and a processor that is mounted on the body and measures biometric information based on the measured contact pressure and the pulse wave signal..,                 ..In addition, the apparatus for measuring biometric information may further include a strap connected to both ends of the main body and fixing the main body to the subject while wrapping the subject..
