No. 14/584,340, filed on Dec. 29, 2014, which claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2013-0169542, filed on Dec. 31, 2013 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference..BACKGROUND.1. Field.Embodiments of the present invention relate to a dish washing machine including a jet nozzle fixed in one side of a washing tank and a vane that is movably provided inside the washing tank and reflects washing water jetted from the jet nozzle toward a dish..2. Description of the Related Art.A dish washing machine is a home appliance that includes a main body having a washing tank therein, a basket configured to accommodate a dish, a sump configured to store washing water, a jet nozzle configured to jet washing water, and a pump configured to supply washing water in the sump to the jet nozzle, and washes the dish by jetting washing water at a high pressure to the dish..In general, dish washing machines use a rotor type jet structure that has a rotating jet nozzle. The rotating nozzle rotates by a hydraulic pressure and jets washing water. Since such a rotating nozzle jets washing water to only a range within a rotation radius, there may be an area in which washing water is not jetted. Therefore, in order to prevent the area in which washing water is not jetted, called a linear type jet structure has been proposed..The linear type jet structure includes a fixed nozzle fixed in one side of a washing tank and a vane that moves in the washing tank and reflects washing water jetted from the fixed jet nozzle toward a dish, and may jet washing water to an entire area of the washing tank according to movement of a reflection plate..The fixed nozzle includes a plurality of jet holes that are arranged in a horizontal direction of the washing tank and is fixed in a back wall side of the washing tank. The vane extends in the horizontal direction of the washing tank to reflect washing water jetted from the plurality of jet holes and may be provided to linearly reciprocate in a forward and backward direction of the washing tank..The linear type jet structure may further include a driving device capable of driving the vane. The driving device may be implemented by various methods. As an example, the driving device includes a motor, a belt connected to the motor and configured to deliver a driving force to the vane, and a rail configured to guide movement of the vane, and when the motor is driven, the belt rotates and the vane moves on the rail..In a distribution device that distributes washing water accumulated in the sump to jet nozzles, a distribution device of a different structure may be preferred in the linear type jet structure, compared to the rotor type jet structure..When a jet nozzle disposed below the washing tank is the rotating nozzle, it is preferable that an outlet of the distribution device be provided to face an upper side since a length of a flow path connecting the outlet of the distribution device and the rotating nozzle may be reduced and a pressure loss of washing water may be minimized..However, when a jet nozzle disposed below the washing tank is the fixed nozzle, since the fixed nozzle is disposed adjacent to the back wall of the washing tank, the outlet of the distribution device need not be provided to face the upper side. When the outlet is provided to face the upper side, since the flow path connecting the outlet of the distribution device and the fixed nozzle should be bent toward the back side at a start point of the outlet of the distribution device, a pressure loss of washing water may increase..Meanwhile, since jet nozzles are fixed in the linear type jet structure, by distributing washing water to only some jet nozzles among all jet nozzles, distributive washing in which washing water is jetted to only some area of the washing tank may be possible..SUMMARY.An aspect of the present invention provides a dish washing machine that minimizes introduction of a foreign substance into a fixed nozzle assembly in a dish washing machine having a linear type jet structure..According to an aspect of the

schematically illustrating a dish washing machine according to an embodiment of the present invention..FIG. 2.is a diagram illustrating a lower part of the dish washing machine in.FIG. 1...An entire structure of the dish washing machine according to the embodiment of the present invention will be generally described with reference to.FIGS. 1 to 2...A.dish washing machine.1.includes a.main body.10.forming an appearance, a.washing tank.30.provided inside the.main body.10.,.baskets.12.a.and.12.b.provided inside the.washing tank.30.and configured to accommodate a dish,.jet nozzles.311.,.313., and.320.configured to jet washing water, a.sump.100.configured to store washing water, a.circulation pump.51.configured to pump washing water of the.sump.100.and supply the water to the.jet nozzles.311.,.313., and.320., a.drainage pump.52.configured to discharge washing water of the.sump.100.along with contaminants to the outside of the.main body.10., a.vane.400.configured to move inside the.washing tank.30.and reflect washing water toward a dish, and a.driving device.420.configured to drive the.vane.400...The.washing tank.30.may have an approximately box shape whose front is opened to receive and remove a dish. A front opening of the.washing tank.30.may be opened or closed by a.door.11.. The.washing tank.30.may include an.upper wall.31., a.back wall.32., a.left side wall.33., a.right side wall.34., and a.bottom plate.35...The.baskets.12.a.and.12.b.may be wire racks made of a wire such that washing water passes through without accumulation. The.baskets.12.a.and.12.b.may be detachably provided inside the washing tank. The.baskets.12.a.and.12.b.may include the.upper basket.12.a.disposed at an upper portion of the.washing tank.30.and the.lower basket.12.b.disposed at a lower portion of the.washing tank.30...The jet nozzles.311.,.313., and.320.may jet washing water at a high pressure and wash a dish. The jet nozzles.311.,.313., and.320.may include the.upper rotation nozzle.311.provided at an upper portion of the.washing tank.30., the.intermediate rotation nozzle.313.provided at a center portion of the.washing tank.30., and the fixed.nozzle assembly.320.provided at a lower portion of the.washing tank.30...The.upper rotation nozzle.311.is provided above the.upper basket.12.a.and may jet washing water downward while rotating due to a hydraulic pressure. For this purpose, jet holes.312.may be provided below the.upper rotation nozzle.311.. The.upper rotation nozzle.311.may directly jet washing water toward a dish accommodated in the.upper basket.12.a..The.intermediate rotation nozzle.313.is provided between the.upper basket.12.a.and the.lower basket.12.b.and may jet washing water upward and downward while rotating due to a hydraulic pressure. For this purpose, jet holes.314.may be provided above and below the.intermediate rotation nozzle.313.. The.intermediate rotation nozzle.313.may directly jet washing water toward dishes accommodated in the.upper basket.12.a.and the.lower basket.12.b..Unlike the.rotation nozzles.311.and.313., the fixed.nozzle assembly.320.is immovably provided and fixed in one side of the.washing tank.30.. The fixed.nozzle assembly.320.is disposed approximately adjacent to the.back wall.32.of the.washing tank.30.and may jet washing water toward the front of the.washing tank.30.. Therefore, washing water jetted from the fixed.nozzle assembly.320.may not be directed directly toward a dish..Washing water jetted from the fixed.nozzle assembly.320.may be reflected toward a dish by the.vane.400.. The fixed.nozzle assembly.320.may be disposed below the.lower basket.12.b.and the.vane.400.may reflect washing water jetted from the fixed.nozzle assembly.320.upward. That is, washing water jetted from the fixed.nozzle assembly.320.may be reflected toward a dish accommodated in the.lower basket.12.b.by the.vane.400...The fixed.nozzle assembly.320.may include a plurality of.jet holes.331.and.341.arranged in a horizontal direction of the.washing tank.30.. The plurality of.jet holes.331.and.341.may jet washing water forward..The.vane.400.may extend in a horizontal direction of the.washing tank.30.such that all washing water jetted from the plurality of.jet holes.331.and.341.of the fixed.nozzle assembly.320.may be reflected. That is, one end portion of the.vane.400.in a lengthwise direction may be provided to be adjacent to the.left side wall.33.of the.washing tank.30.and the other end portion of the.vane.400.in the lengthwise direction may be provided to be adjacent to the.right side wall.34.of the.washing tank.30...The.vane.400.may linearly reciprocate in a jet direction of washing water jetted from the fixed.nozzle assembly.320.. That is, the.vane.400.may linearly reciprocate in a forward and backward direction of the.washing tank.30...Therefore, a linear jet structure including the fixed.nozzle assembly.320.and the.vane.400.may wash an entire area of the.washing tank.30.without a blind area. It is different from the rotation nozzles that can jet washing water within a range of a rotation radius..The fixed.nozzle assembly.320.may include a left.fixed nozzle.330.disposed on the left of the.washing tank.30.and a right.fixed nozzle.360.disposed on the right of the.washing tank.30...As will be described below, the.rotation nozzles.311.and.313.and the fixed.nozzle assembly.320.may independently jet washing water. Further, the left fixed.nozzle.330.and the right.fixed nozzle.360.may also independently jet washing water..Washing water jetted from the left fixed.nozzle.330.may be reflected to only a left area of the.washing tank.30.by the.vane.400., and washing water jetted from the right.fixed nozzle.360.may be reflected to only a right area of the.washing tank.30.by the.vane.400...Therefore, the dish washing machine may independently wash the left side and the right side of the.washing tank.30.in a divided manner. Needless to say, unlike this embodiment in which the washing tank is divided into the left side and the right side, the washing tank may be subdivided further as necessary..A main configuration of the dish washing machine according to the embodiment of the present invention will be described in order below..FIG. 3.is a diagram illustrating a flow path structure of the dish washing machine in.FIG. 1...FIG. 4A.is perspective view of the fixed nozzle assembly of the dish washing machine in.FIG. 1...FIGS. 4B and 4C.are exploded diagrams illustrating the fixed nozzle assembly of the dish washing machine in.FIG. 1...FIGS. 5A and 5B.are cross sectional views of the fixed nozzle assembly of the dish washing machine in.FIG. 1...FIG. 5C.is an enlarged view of a part of.FIG. 5B...A process, the flow path structure, a structure of the fixed nozzle assembly, and a washing water distribution structure of the dish washing machine according to the embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to.FIGS. 3 to 5...The dish washing machine may include a water supplying process, a washing process, a draining process, and a drying process..In the water supplying process, washing water may be supplied into the.washing tank.30.through a water supply pipe (not illustrated). Washing water supplied into the.washing tank.30.may flow into the.sump.100.provided below the.washing tank.30.due to an inclination of the.bottom plate.35.of the.washing tank.30.and may be stored in the.sump.100...In the washing process, the.circulation pump.51.may be operated to pump washing water of the.sump.100.. Washing water pumped by the.circulation pump.51.may be distributed to the.rotation nozzles.311.and.313., the left fixed.nozzle.330., and the right.fixed nozzle.360.through a.distribution device.200.. Due to a pumping force of the.circulation pump.51., washing water at a high pressure may be jetted from the.jet nozzles.311.,.313., and.320.and wash a dish..Here, the.upper rotation nozzle.311.and the.intermediate rotation nozzle.313.may receive washing water from the.distribution device.200.through a.second hose.271.b.. The left.fixed nozzle.330.may receive washing water from the.distribution device.200.through a.first hose.271.a..

The.third outlet.212.c.may be connected to the right.fixed nozzle.360.through the.third hose.271.c.(.FIG. 3.)..In this manner, since each of the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c.is connected to the.jet nozzle.311.,.313., or.320.that is closest thereto, lengths of the.hoses.271.a.,.271.b., and.271.c.may decrease, no twist may occur and a pressure loss of washing water may decrease..A sump combining portion.213.to be combined with the.sump.100.may be provided in the.housing.210.and a distribution device combining portion.109.(.FIG. 3.) to be combined with the sump combining portion.213.may be provided in the.sump.100.. In this embodiment, the sump combining portion.213.is provided in the form of a groove and the distribution.device combining portion.109.may be provided in the form of a protrusion. When the sump combining portion.213.and the distribution.device combining portion.109.are combined, positions of the.distribution device.200.and the.sump.100.may be aligned..The opening and closing.member.220.selectively opens or closes the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c.while rotating with respect to the axis direction of the.housing.210.inside the.housing.210.. Therefore, the opening and closing.member.220.may substantially distribute washing water to the.jet nozzles.311.,.313., and.320...The opening and closing.member.220.has an approximately hollow cylindrical shape. The opening and closing.member.220.includes a.rotation body.221.rotating inside the.housing.210.and a sealing.members.225.to be combined with the.rotation body.221.to close the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c..Communicating.holes.222.may be formed in a circumferential surface of the.rotation body.221.. When the communicating.holes.222.are positioned to correspond to the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c., washing water may be smoothly discharged to the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c..Also,.separation protrusions.224.may be formed in the circumferential surface of the.rotation body.221.. The protrusions separate a predetermined interval an inner circumferential surface of the.housing.210.and an outer circumferential surface of the.rotation body.221.such that a friction with the.housing.210.is minimized and the opening and closing.member.220.may smoothly rotate when the opening and closing.member.220.rotates inside the.housing.210.. The inner circumferential surface of the.housing.210.and the outer circumferential surface of the.rotation body.221.may always maintain a predetermined interval by the.separation protrusions.224...Also, locking.holes.223.with which the sealing.members.225.are combined may be formed in a circumferential surface of the.rotation body.221.. Locking.protrusions.227.of the sealing.members.225.are combined with the locking holes.223.. The locking holes.223.may have different shapes corresponding to shapes of the locking.protrusions.227.of the sealing.members.225...As an example, the locking.hole.223.at the center may have an approximately cross shape and the locking holes.223.at both sides may have a straight line shape..Similarly, the locking.protrusion.227.of the sealing.member.225.at the center may have a cross shape and the locking.protrusions.227.at both sides may have a straight line shape..Different shapes are provided in this manner so that it is possible to easily identify the difference when the sealing.member.225.to be combined at the center and the sealing.members.225.to be combined at both sides have different shapes during assembly..Between both end portions of the.rotation body.221.in the axis direction, one end portion corresponding to the.inlet.211.of the.housing.210.is opened. In the other end portion between end portions of the.rotation body.221.in the axis direction, a cam.shaft combining portion.229.with which a.cam shaft.241.of the.cam member.240.is combined is provided..The sealing.members.225.are combined with the circumferential surface of the.rotation body.221.to close the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c..

The sealing.members.225.are slightly movable and combined with the locking holes.223.of the.rotation body.221.in a radial direction. This is because the sealing.members.225.come in close contact with the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c.to reinforce sealing of the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c..That is, the sealing.members.225.move between an open position in close contact with the.rotation body.221.and a close position in close contact with the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c.. When washing water is introduced into the.housing.210., the sealing.members.225.may naturally move from the open position to the close position due to a hydraulic pressure of washing water. Therefore, a sealing force of the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c.increases and reliability of the.distribution device.200.may be improved..The sealing.member.225.includes a sealing portion.226.(.FIG. 8.) having a curved surface shape to come in close contact with the.outlets.212.a.,.212.b., and.212.c.and the locking.protrusion.227.that protrudes from the sealing.portion.226.to be inserted into the.locking hole.223.of the.rotation body.221...The locking.protrusion.227.and the.locking hole.223.may have a slight gap such that the sealing.member.225.is movable in the radial direction.

When the.jet nozzle.1300.is integrally formed in the fixed.nozzle assembly.1340., since the fixed.nozzle assembly.1340.itself should be changed, it is inefficient. Therefore, it may be provided such that only the.jet nozzle.1300.can be replaced..A.screw thread portion.1310.may be formed in an outer circumferential surface of the.jet nozzle.1300.to be combined with the fixed.nozzle assembly.1340..

As the.vane.1380.moves toward the.jet nozzle.1350., it presses the.pressing protrusion.1374.of the opening and.closing member.1370.. Specifically, in the.vane.1380., a.reflection surface.1382.in which washing water is bent is formed to extend toward the opening and.closing member.1370.. When the.vane.1380.moves toward the.jet nozzle.1350., it presses the.pressing protrusion.1374.of the opening and.closing member.1370.by the.extended reflection surface.1382...The opening and.closing member.1370.pressed by the.pressing protrusion.1374.moves upward and therefore the opening and closing unit opens the.sub jet hole.1364.. During this process, washing water flowing in the.jet flow path.1360.is discharged through a washing.water jet hole.1362.and the.sub jet hole.1364., and is jetted above the fixed nozzle assembly. In other words, the opening and.closing member.1370.moves from the close position P.2.to the open position P.1.by movement of the.vane.1380., the.sub jet hole.1364.is opened, and washing water is jetted through the.sub jet hole.1364...When washing water is bent by only the.vane.1380., only an upper part on a movement path of the.vane.1380.is influenced. In this case, an upper part of the fixed nozzle assembly that is not on the movement path of the.vane.1380.is not washed by washing water..However, since washing water may be branched above the fixed nozzle assembly by selectively opening the.sub jet hole.1364., it is possible to decrease a blind area that is not influenced by washing water.

In this case, an upper part of the fixed nozzle assembly that is not on the movement path of the.vane.1410.is not washed by washing water..However, while the.sub vane.1420.moves from the waiting position P.1.to the reflection position P.2., since the traveling direction of washing water may be bent at a right angle or more, it is possible to decrease a blind area that is not influenced by washing water. Also, according to such operations, contaminants to be accumulated in the fixed nozzle assembly or the jet nozzle may be washed, a lifespan of the dish washing machine may increase, and an odor and the like caused by contaminants may be prevented..In the above embodiments, each embodiment in which some configurations of the dish washing machine are different has been described, but these may be applied together rather than independently, and descriptions of redundant configurations were omitted..[A Structure of a Nozzle to Prevent Introduction of a Foreign Substance].According to the fixed nozzle assembly of the present invention and the dish washing machine having the same, since the jet nozzle may be maintained clean, durability of the fixed nozzle assembly may increase..[Floral-Patterned Nozzle].According to the jet unit of the present invention and the dish washing machine having the same, since linearity of the jet nozzle may be improved and a size of the jet unit may be reduced accordingly, it is possible to implement a compact dish washing machine..Also, since a flow rate of washing water may increase, it is possible to increase washing efficiency..In addition, it is possible to increase durability of the jet nozzle..The scope of the present invention is not limited to the above-described specific embodiments.
