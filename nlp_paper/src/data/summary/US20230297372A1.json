  "problem": "Inefficient computational performance and limited flexibility in conventional vector processing units (VPUs) for handling dimensional arrays of data, especially in technology fields like numerical simulations, graphics processing, gaming console design, supercomputing, and machine learning computations for Deep Neural Networks (DNN) layers.",
  "solution_function": "Partition computations into: a) a SIMD VPU with increased flexibility and memory bandwidth requirements but low computational density; b) a Matrix Unit (MXU) with lower flexibility, low memory bandwidth requirements, and high computational density; c) a Cross-Lane Unit (XU) for performing operations that don't fit into the SIMD paradigm but also have less computational density than MXU operations. The VPU performs arithmetic operations associated with vectorized computations for multi-dimensional data arrays, and it communicates with a tightly coupled vector memory to exchange data at high bandwidth.",
  "solution_structure": "The solution consists of one or more processor units configured for arithmetic operations, a vector memory in data communication with each processor unit, and memory banks within the vector memory. In some implementations, it also includes a Matrix Operation Unit that receives operands from a particular processor unit, first and second Data Serializers to serialize output data from the processor unit.",
  "solution_implementation": "In some implementations, the VPU operates in a Von-Neumann SIMD architecture. The data communication between the processor units and vector memory is optimized for high bandwidth based on their placement within the VPU. The Matrix Operation Unit performs operations associated with vectorized computations using operands from a particular processor unit.",
  "effect": "Enhanced performance and flexibility in SIMD processor design architecture, resulting in improved efficiency for technology fields like numerical simulations, graphics processing, gaming console design, supercomputing, and machine learning computations.",
