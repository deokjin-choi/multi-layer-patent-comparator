  "problem": "Inefficient management and optimization of wind farms due to complex interactions between multiple turbines, unique characteristics, changing conditions, and predictive maintenance schedules.",
  "solution_function": "A digital twin interface that provides a simplified, effective way for users to optimize the performance of the wind farm over time and adapt to changing conditions by displaying a graphical representation of the wind farm with environmental information and control icons corresponding to each turbine, which function as virtual control dials.",
  "solution_structure": "The digital twin interface consists of a graphical user interface (GUI), a digital model of the wind farm, and individual control icons for each wind turbine within the farm.",
  "solution_implementation": "Users interact with the digital twin interface through the GUI, manipulating the control icons to adjust the settings of each turbine. The system collects and processes data from the turbines and meteorological sensors in real-time to update the digital model and provide accurate environmental information.",
  "effect": "Improved management and optimization of wind farms, resulting in increased energy production, efficiency, and adaptability to changing conditions.",
