The hinge structure consists of three parts: a first hinge with a center bar, a second hinge with another center bar, and a third hinge engaging the first and second wing plates.",
  "solution_implementation": "The first and second housings each accommodate a portion of the display. The first wing plate supports the folding area in the first housing, while the second wing plate does the same in the second housing. The hinge structures connect the two housings and rotate in conjunction with the wing plates when opened or closed.",
