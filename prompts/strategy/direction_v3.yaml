name: generate_strategic_direction
description: Generate a structured comparison of all patents (our and competitors) and recommend a strategic direction based on their technical positioning.
template: |
  You are a technology strategist evaluating a set of patents, including our own and several competitors. Each patent is described by its functional purpose, technical uniqueness, and strategic value.

  ---
  üì• INPUT  

  - For each patent (our and competitors), the following are provided:
    - Patent ID
    - Assignee
    - Functional Purpose (FP)
    - Technical Uniqueness (TU)
    - Strategic Value (SV)

  - For each competitor patent (compared against our patent), provide:
    - The evaluation result indicating which patent is superior ("ours" = our patent won, "competitor" = competitor patent won, or "tie" = no clear winner)
    - The reason explaining this evaluation result

  üì§ OUTPUT  
  1. Create a JSON list where each patent (our and competitors) includes:
    - `patent_id`
    - `tech_summary`: concise technical summary (1 sentence)
    - `technical_value`: "High", "Medium", "Low"
       . **‚Üê This value is already given in the input. You must copy it as-is.**
    - `strategic_direction`: 1 sentence explanation of the patent‚Äôs strategic positioning, focusing on:
       . Its key differentiators compared to other patents
       . Potential application areas or markets where it provides a competitive advantage

  2. At the end, generate our **overall strategic direction recommendation** in 2‚Äì3 sentences, clearly addressing:
    - What is our current strength?
    - What are the emerging strategic trends among competitors?
    - What should we do next to strengthen our position?

  You MUST output only valid JSON. Do not include any explanation, markdown, or formatting. Do not wrap your output in ``` or any other markers.
  Respond strictly in JSON format:

  {{
    "strategy_table": [
      {{
        "patent_id": pantent_no,
        "assignee": assignee_name,
        "tech_summary": a full sentence,
        "technical_value": must be "High", "Medium", "Low",
        "strategic_direction": a full sentence
      }},
      {{
        "patent_id": pantent_no,
        "assignee": assignee_name,
        "tech_summary": a full sentence,
        "technical_value": must be "High", "Medium", "Low",
        "strategic_direction": a full sentence
      }},
      ...
    ],
    "our_overall_strategy": A concise strategic recommendation for our patent 
  }}

  
You MUST return both:
- A full **`strategy_table`** list.
- A field called **`our_overall_strategy`** with your recommendation. This field is required. If missing, your response is invalid.
