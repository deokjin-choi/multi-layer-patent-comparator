name: generate_strategic_direction
description: Generate a structured comparative analysis of all patents (our and competitors), and recommend a strategic direction for our patent based on relative technical positioning.
template: |
  You are a technology strategist evaluating a group of patents, including our own and those of competitors.

  üéØ YOUR GOAL

  Your objective is to:
  1. Summarize each patent‚Äôs core technical approach (tech_summary).
  2. Describe the **relative strategic positioning** of each patent (strategic_direction), focusing on:
     - How it is differentiated from other patents in the group
     - Which specific **application areas or markets** the patent offers a clear competitive advantage in
     - Avoid vague or general expressions like ‚Äúcompliance‚Äù, ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù, or ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù unless **specific context or industry** is provided
  3. Based on the full set of patents, generate a concise **overall strategic recommendation for our patent** (our_overall_strategy), addressing:
     - What is our current strength relative to others?
     - What strategic trends are visible among competitor patents?
     - What should we do next to strengthen our position?

  üì• INPUT

  For each patent (our and competitors), the following information is provided:
    - Patent ID
    - Assignee
    - Functional Purpose (FP)
    - Technical Uniqueness (TU)
    - Strategic Value (SV)

  For each competitor patent (compared against our patent), provide:
    - The evaluation result indicating which patent is superior ("ours" = our patent won, "competitor" = competitor patent won, or "tie" = no clear winner)
    - The reason explaining this evaluation result

  üì§ OUTPUT  
  1. Create a JSON list where each patent (our and competitors) includes:
    - `patent_id`
    - `tech_summary`
    - `technical_value`: "High", "Medium", "Low"
       . **‚Üê This value is already given in the input. You must copy it as-is.**
    - `strategic_direction`: 1 sentence explanation of the patent‚Äôs strategic positioning

  2. At the end, generate our **overall strategic direction recommendation** in 2‚Äì3 sentences, clearly addressing:
    - What is our current strength compared to other patents?
    - What strategic patterns or trends are seen across competitors?
    - What specific action should we take to enhance our technical or strategic position?

  You MUST output only valid JSON. Do not include any explanation, markdown, or formatting. Do not wrap your output in ``` or any other markers.
  Respond strictly in JSON format:

  {{
    "strategy_table": [
      {{
        "patent_id": pantent_no,
        "assignee": assignee_name,
        "tech_summary": a full sentence,
        "technical_value": must be "High", "Medium", "Low",
        "strategic_direction": a full sentence
      }},
      {{
        "patent_id": pantent_no,
        "assignee": assignee_name,
        "tech_summary": a full sentence,
        "technical_value": must be "High", "Medium", "Low",
        "strategic_direction": a full sentence
      }},
      ...
    ],
    "our_overall_strategy": A concise strategic recommendation for our patent 
  }}

  
You MUST return both:
- A full **`strategy_table`** list.
- A field called **`our_overall_strategy`** with your recommendation. This field is required. If missing, your response is invalid.
