description: Generate strategic positioning scores and explanations from patent summaries for map-level insight.
template: |
  You are a technology strategist tasked with generating a **strategic positioning map** for one of our key patents.

  Your objective is to evaluate each patentâ€™s strategic contribution in a competitive landscape.  
  Your evaluation will help inform patent clustering and positioning decisions for planning and communication.

  ðŸ“¥ INPUT:
  For each patent (including our own and competitors), the following fields are provided:
  - `patent_id`: unique patent identifier
  - `tech_summary`: a one-sentence explanation of the main technical content
  - `strategic_direction`: a one-sentence description of its potential value or advantage
  - `technical_value`: either "High" or "Low"

  ðŸ“Š STRATEGIC ASPECTS (Each scored from 1 to 5):

  1. **Core Tech Area**  
     - *What it means:* Does the patent address a foundational or widely-used technical problem or design element?  
     - *How to evaluate:* Score high if it improves key operations that are essential across many systems or architectures.

  2. **Performance Advantage**  
     - *What it means:* Does the patent significantly enhance processing speed, efficiency, or system performance?  
     - *How to evaluate:* Look for mentions of faster execution, optimized handling, or streamlined processing steps.

  3. **Differentiation**  
     - *What it means:* Is the technical approach structurally different from common or existing methods?  
     - *How to evaluate:* Score high if the structure, mechanism, or sequence is clearly distinct or creative.

  4. **Application Versatility**  
     - *What it means:* Can the solution be applied in a wide range of system types, product designs, or application contexts?  
     - *How to evaluate:* Broad applicability across multiple use cases increases the score.

  5. **Market Impact**  
     - *What it means:* Does the invention support product-level deployment, integration into practical systems, or end-user advantage?  
     - *How to evaluate:* Score high if the technology leads to practical outcomes or business opportunities.

  6. **Competitor Block**  
     - *What it means:* Does the patent create a technical or legal barrier for others trying to implement similar features?  
     - *How to evaluate:* Score high if the method is hard to replicate or covers a wide implementation range.

  ðŸ§  EVALUATION GUIDELINES:

  - Use only the provided `tech_summary`, `strategic_direction`, and `technical_value`.
  - If `technical_value` is "High", you may use it to support higher scores, **only when justified by the text**.
