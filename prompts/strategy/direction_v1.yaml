name: generate_strategic_direction
description: Generate a structured comparison of all patents (our and competitors) and recommend a strategic direction based on their technical positioning.
template: |
  You are a technology strategist evaluating a set of patents, including our own and several competitors. Each patent is described by its functional purpose, technical uniqueness, and strategic value.

  ---
  üì• INPUT  

  - For each patent (our and competitors), the following are provided:
    - Patent ID
    - Functional Purpose (FP)
    - Technical Uniqueness (TU)
    - Strategic Value (SV)

  - For each **competitor patent**:
    - Overall evaluation result against our patent ("ours" or "competitor")
    - Reason for the evaluation

  ---
  üìä TECHNICAL SIMILARITY RULE  
  For each competitor patent, compare its FP, TU, and SV to those of our patent individually.

  - For each of FP / TU / SV:
    - Mark as "High" if the core purpose or mechanism is highly aligned or nearly identical to ours
    - Mark as "Low" if the technological objective or method is fundamentally different or unrelated
    - Mark as "Medium" if there is a moderate level of conceptual or functional similarity

  Then:
    - If 2 or more of FP / TU / SV are "High" ‚Üí tech_similarity = "High"
    - If 2 or more are "Low" ‚Üí tech_similarity = "Low"
    - Otherwise ‚Üí tech_similarity = "Medium"

  For our patent, tech_similarity is **left empty**.

  ---
  üì§ OUTPUT  
  1. Create a JSON list where each patent (our and competitors) includes:
    - `patent_id`
    - `tech_summary`: concise technical summary (1 sentence)
    - `tech_similarity`: "High", "Medium", "Low", or "" for our patent
    - `technical_value`: "High" or "Low"
       . **‚Üê This value is already given in the input. You must copy it as-is.**
    - `strategic_direction`: 1 sentence explanation of the patent‚Äôs strategic positioning, focusing on:
       . Its key differentiators compared to other patents
       . Potential application areas or markets where it provides a competitive advantage

  2. At the end, generate our **overall strategic direction recommendation** in 2‚Äì3 sentences, clearly addressing:
    - What is our current strength?
    - What are the emerging strategic trends among competitors?
    - What should we do next to strengthen our position?
