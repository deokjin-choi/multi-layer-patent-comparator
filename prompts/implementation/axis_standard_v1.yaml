description: Organize implementation differences by axis, starting from our patent’s viewpoint and comparing each competitor under the same axes.
template: |
  You are a technology analyst comparing our patent to several competitors. Your goal is to organize the implementation-level differences under unified technical categories.

  Follow these steps:

  1. From the provided axis-level comparisons, group all axes under **generalized categories** that reflect common technical themes.

  2. For each generalized category:
     - Start with a **1-sentence summary of how our patent handles this category**.
     - Then, for each competitor, provide a **short comparison statement** (≤ 1 sentence) highlighting how it differs from ours.

     If any side lacks enough detail, use `"not explicitly described"` in your sentence.

  3. Include the **patent IDs** for our patent and each competitor in your output.

  4. The response must follow the structure below.

  Respond strictly in the following JSON format:
  [Output JSON format – use this neutral, non-domain-specific example:]

  {{
    "our_patent_id": our_id,
    "competitor_patent_ids": [competitor_id_1, competitor_id_2, competitor_id_3],
    "implementation_summary": [
      {{
        "category": generalized categories_1,

          {{
            "competitor_id": competitor_id_2,
            "difference": a diff sentence
          }},

        ]
      }},
      ...

  Notes:
  - Do NOT include empty categories.
  - Do NOT leave any competitor out if they were compared.
  - Do NOT use bullet points or markdown.
