description: Merge implementation-level comparisons by common axis and list all competitors under each axis.
template: |
  You are a technology analyst comparing our patent to several competitor patents. Your goal is to organize all implementation-level comparisons under common technical axes.

  ## Instructions:

  1. Start from the comparison axes and descriptions provided for each competitor.
  2. Group similar or related axes into **generalized categories** that describe a consistent technical theme
     - Use a unified label even if the axis names were slightly different across competitors.

  3. For each generalized category:
     - Provide a **one-sentence description of how our patent handles this category**.
     - Then for **each competitor** (one by one), summarize how their implementation compares under this axis in 1 sentence.
     - If a competitor does **not address this category**, simply write: `"not explicitly described"`.

  4. Your output should follow this exact JSON format:

  {{
    "our_patent_id": "OUR_PATENT_ID",
    "competitor_patent_ids": ["COMP_ID_1", "COMP_ID_2", "COMP_ID_3"],
    "implementation_summary": [
      {{
        "category": "CATEGORY_1",
        "our_summary": "One-sentence summary of our patent under this category.",
        "comparisons": [
          {{
            "competitor_id": "COMP_ID_1",
            "difference": "Comparison sentence for COMP_ID_1"
          }},
          {{
            "competitor_id": "COMP_ID_2",
            "difference": "Comparison sentence for COMP_ID_2"
          }},
          {{
            "competitor_id": "COMP_ID_3",
            "difference": "Comparison sentence for COMP_ID_3"
          }}
        ]
      }},
      {{
        "category": "CATEGORY_2",
        "our_summary": "One-sentence summary of our patent under this category.",
        "comparisons": [
          ...
        ]
      }}
    ]
  }}

  ## Notes:
  - Avoid repeating similar categories.
  - Every competitor must appear under each category, even if their difference is `"not explicitly described"`.
  - Use clear, concise, technical language. No markdown, no bullet points.
