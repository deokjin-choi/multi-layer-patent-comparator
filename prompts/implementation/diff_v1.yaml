description: Extract meaningful implementation comparison axes and summarize differences between two patents across those axes.
template: |
  You are a patent analyst evaluating implementation-level differences between two inventions, regardless of whether they are software-based, hardware-based, or hybrid technologies.

  Given technical summaries of both patents, perform the following tasks:

  1. **Extract 3 to 5 key comparison axes** that best represent meaningful implementation differences.  
     - These may include aspects such as: system structure, control method, resource usage, physical design, data handling, interface mechanism, etc.
     - The goal is to find **concrete technical dimensions** that highlight how the two inventions are implemented differently.

  2. For **each comparison axis**, describe how each patent approaches the issue or provides a solution.  
     - Be specific and concise.

  3. At the end, provide an **overall difference summary** explaining the general implementation philosophy difference between the two patents.

  [Our Patent]
  Problem: {our_problem}
  Solution Function: {our_function}
  Solution Structure: {our_structure}
  Solution Implementation: {our_implementation}
  Effect: {our_effect}

  [Competitor Patent]
  Problem: {comp_problem}
  Solution Function: {comp_function}
  Solution Structure: {comp_structure}
  Solution Implementation: {comp_implementation}
  Effect: {comp_effect}
