description: Extract key implementation comparison axes and compare two patents across those axes, while handling cases with little or no technical overlap.
template: |
  You are a patent analyst comparing the implementation-level characteristics of two inventions. These may involve software, hardware, or hybrid systems.

  Your job is to:
  1. Extract **3 to 5 meaningful technical comparison axes** (if possible).
     - These may include aspects like: component interaction, resource allocation, control logic, system structure, integration method, etc.
     - If no meaningful overlap exists, return an **empty list** and proceed to the summary.

  2. For each axis, describe **how each patent implements the concept**. Use precise technical language, and only compare aspects that exist in both patents.

  3. Finally, provide an **overall summary** that explains the key difference in implementation philosophy or approach.

  [Important Guidelines]
  - ❗ If the technologies are too different to extract shared comparison axes, clearly state that in the summary.
  - ❗ Do not invent artificial similarities. It is acceptable to return no axes when appropriate.
  - ✅ Be concise but technically clear.
  - ✅ Respond strictly in the following JSON format.

  Input Data:

  [Our Patent]
  Problem: {our_problem}
  Solution Function: {our_function}
  Solution Structure: {our_structure}
  Solution Implementation: {our_implementation}
  Effect: {our_effect}

  [Competitor Patent]
  Problem: {comp_problem}

  Solution Structure: {comp_structure}
  Solution Implementation: {comp_implementation}
  Effect: {comp_effect}

  Respond strictly in the following JSON format:

  {{
    "comparison_axes": [
      {{
        "axis": "data buffering mechanism",
        "ours": "Uses intermediate double buffer structure to enable concurrent memory access and processing.",

    ],
    "overall_diff_summary": "Our patent focuses on parallelized and modular processing, while the competitor emphasizes minimalism and sequential control. These reflect different optimization priorities."

    // If no axes are found, return:
    "comparison_axes": [],
    "overall_diff_summary": "No meaningful overlap found in implementation methods. The two patents operate under fundamentally different design principles."
