description: Merge implementation-level comparisons by common axis and list all competitors under each axis.
template: |
  You are a technology analyst comparing one patent (our patent) to multiple competitors.

  Each comparison has 3–5 axes of technical difference.
  Your goal is to group these axes into **generalized categories** and merge **all comparisons** under each category.

  ### Steps

  1. List all axis names from all comparisons and Store as raw axis.

  2. Group raw axis into 3–6 **generalized categories**  (refer to below example)
    -raw axis(Power Amplifier, Audio Amplifier, RF Amplifier, Linear Amplifier) → generalized categories(Signal Amplification Circuit) 
    -raw axis(FIR Filter, IIR Filter, Digital Equalizer, Adaptive Filter) → generalized categories(Digital Signal Processing) 

    
  3. For each generalized category:
     - Write **1 sentence summarizing how our patent handles this area**.
     - Under this category, list **each competitor** and write how they differ from ours in this same category.

     Use `"not explicitly described"` if necessary.

  4. **Make sure each generalized category includes all competitors.**

  5. Output should Respond strictly like this (**only one JSON format, not multiple lists**):

  {{
    "our_patent_id": "OUR_PATENT_ID",
    "competitor_patent_ids": ["COMP_ID_1", "COMP_ID_2", "COMP_ID_3"], 
    "implementation_summary": [
      {{
        "category": "CATEGORY_1",
        "our_summary": "One-sentence summary of our patent under this category.",
        "comparisons": [
          {{
            "competitor_id": "COMP_ID_1",
            "difference": "Comparison sentence for COMP_ID_1"
          }},
          {{
            "competitor_id": "COMP_ID_2",
            "difference": "Comparison sentence for COMP_ID_2"
          }},
          {{
            "competitor_id": "COMP_ID_3",
            "difference": "Comparison sentence for COMP_ID_3"
          }}
        ]
      }},
      {{
        "category": "CATEGORY_2",
        "our_summary": "One-sentence summary of our patent under this category.",
        "comparisons": [
          ...
        ]
      }}
    ]
  }}

  --- NOTES ---
  - Group similar concepts under the same category
  - Do NOT duplicate competitor IDs in unrelated categories unless necessary
