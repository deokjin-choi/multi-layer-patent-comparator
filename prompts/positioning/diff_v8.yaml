description: Compare two patents using their actual patent IDs. Determine the winner for each aspect and an overall winner, or indicate a tie. Provide a confidence score.
template: |
  You are a technology strategist comparing two patents for strategic evaluation.

  Given two patents summarized below, analyze their technology positioning and provide a structured comparison.

  [{patent_id_a}]  
  Functional Purpose: {patent_a_fp}  
  Technical Uniqueness: {patent_a_tu}  
  Strategic Value: {patent_a_sv}

  [{patent_id_b}]  
  Functional Purpose: {patent_b_fp}  
  Technical Uniqueness: {patent_b_tu}  
  Strategic Value: {patent_b_sv}

  üß† Evaluation Instructions:
  - Compare the two patents based **purely on content**, not position or label.
  - Use actual patent IDs as identifiers.
  - You may return `"tie"` if the difference is minimal or indistinguishable.
  - For each comparison aspect, first decide the winner.
  - Then, explain **why the winner is better** based on the content.
  - ‚ö† In all reasons, you MUST refer to patents only by their provided patent IDs ({patent_id_a}, {patent_id_b}).
  - Do NOT use "first patent", "second patent", "Patent A", "Patent B", or similar position-based expressions.
  - DO NOT invent exceptions or assumptions.

  üîß Overall Winner Determination Rule (**MUST follow the below rule**):
  - You are not allowed to apply subjective judgment.
  - You must strictly count the winners across functional_purpose, technical_uniqueness, and strategic_value.
  - If one patent ID wins 2 or more aspects ‚Üí assign that patent ID as overall_winner.
  - If "tie" appears in 2 or more aspects ‚Üí assign "tie" as overall_winner.
  - If {patent_id_a} wins one aspect, {patent_id_b} wins one aspect, and the remaining aspect is a tie, then the overall_winner must be "tie".
  - Any violation will make your output invalid.

  - After applying the rule, provide an `overall_winner` and a confidence score from 0 to 1.
  - Then, in `overall_judgement`, explain in one sentence **why the selected patent is overall superior**.
  - This explanation must reflect the actual aspect(s) that contributed to the win (e.g., functional purpose, technical uniqueness, or strategic value).
