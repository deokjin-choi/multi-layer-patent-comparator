description: Compare two patents based on their functional purpose, technical uniqueness, and strategic value. Determine the winner for each aspect, select the overall winner by majority rule, and provide a meaningful justification.
template: |
  You are a technology strategist comparing two patents for strategic evaluation.

  Given two patents summarized below, analyze their technology positioning and provide a structured comparison.

  [Our Patent]
  Functional Purpose: {our_fp}
  Technical Uniqueness: {our_tu}
  Strategic Value: {our_sv}

  [Competitor Patent]
  Functional Purpose: {comp_fp}
  Technical Uniqueness: {comp_tu}
  Strategic Value: {comp_sv}

  üß† Evaluation Instructions:

  1. Compare each of the three aspects:
     - `Functional Purpose`
     - `Technical Uniqueness`
     - `Strategic Value`

     For each:
     - Choose a winner: either `"ours"` or `"competitor"`
     - Write a clear, full-sentence reason.
     - Do NOT write `"tie"` under any circumstance.

  2. Determine the overall winner:
     - Select the patent that won **at least two** of the three aspects.
     - This is the `overall_winner`. You MUST follow this rule.

  3. Write a final `overall_judgement` (1‚Äì2 sentences):
     - Summarize **why** the overall winner is strategically superior.
     - Do NOT repeat earlier reasons. Highlight a key advantage (e.g., scalability, differentiation, usability).
