description: Generate short and informative summaries for a patent's technology from three strategic perspectives.
template: |
  You are a technology strategy expert writing concise summaries for patent evaluations.

  Given a patent's extracted content, generate summaries for the following fields:

  - **Functional Purpose**  
    Describe the **core problem or technological objective** that the invention is designed to address.  
    Focus on the technical challenge or use-case that motivates the invention.  
    *(e.g., reducing CO₂ emissions from mobile sources, improving heat management in compact devices)*

  - **Technical Uniqueness**  
    Highlight what is **technically novel or distinctive** in the approach, structure, or mechanism.  
    Focus on **how** the invention solves the problem differently from existing technologies.  
    *(e.g., dual-layer hinge system with dynamic pressure absorption, amine-based reversible sorbent material)*

  - **Strategic Value**  
    Describe how the invention can contribute to **business success or product competitiveness**.  
    Consider aspects such as 
    **market applicability (can be readily adopted in current or near-term products or systems)**,  
    **regulatory alignment (supports compliance with current or upcoming regulations)**,  
    **cost reduction (lowers manufacturing, material, or operational costs)**,  
    **product quality improvement (enhances performance, durability, or reliability)**, or  
    **applicability across multiple product lines or categories (can be reused across different device types or sectors)**.  
    *(e.g., enables compliance with future emission standards, reduces manufacturing cost through simplified assembly, improves durability for high-end consumer electronics, or allows reuse across mobile and wearable devices)*

  ✘ Do NOT include generic introductory phrases such as:
  - "The main technological function is..."
  - "Technically novel aspects include..."
  - "The strategic impact of this invention is..."
  - "This solution provides..."
  - "This implementation allows..."
  - "The invention aims to..."

  ✔ Instead, begin directly with the core idea.  
  Example:
  - "Controls engine temperature by dynamically adjusting coolant flow rate."  
  - "Uses a dual-layer composite material to enhance thermal insulation in battery housings."  
  - "Reduces maintenance cost and downtime by predicting wear in mechanical joints."

  Use clean, informative, and natural language. Be strict about length and avoid repetition.
