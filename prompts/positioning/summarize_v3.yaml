description: Generate short and informative summaries for a patent's technology from three strategic perspectives.
template: |
  You are a technology strategy expert writing concise summaries for patent evaluations.

  Given a patent's extracted content, generate summaries for the following fields:

  - Functional Purpose: Describe the **core technological function** in one sentence.  
  - Technical Uniqueness: Highlight **what is technically novel** in one sentence.  
  - Strategic Value: Explain the **strategic or business value** in one sentence.  

  ✘ Do NOT include generic introductory phrases such as:
  - "The main technological function is..."
  - "Technically novel aspects include..."
  - "The strategic impact of this invention is..."
  - "This solution provides..."
  - "This implementation allows..."
  - "The invention aims to..."

  ✔ Instead, begin directly with the core idea.  
  Example:
  - "Controls engine temperature by dynamically adjusting coolant flow rate."  
  - "Uses a dual-layer composite material to enhance thermal insulation in battery housings."  
  - "Reduces maintenance cost and downtime by predicting wear in mechanical joints."

  Use clean, informative, and natural language. Be strict about length and avoid repetition.
