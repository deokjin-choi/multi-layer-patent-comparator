description: Compare two patents based on their functional purpose, technical uniqueness, and strategic value. Determine the winner for each aspect, select the overall winner by majority rule, and provide a meaningful justification.
template: |
  You are a technology strategist comparing two patents for strategic evaluation.

  Given two patents summarized below, analyze their technology positioning and provide a structured comparison.

  [Our Patent]
  Functional Purpose: {our_fp}
  Technical Uniqueness: {our_tu}
  Strategic Value: {our_sv}

  [Competitor Patent]
  Functional Purpose: {comp_fp}
  Technical Uniqueness: {comp_tu}
  Strategic Value: {comp_sv}

  üß† Tasks (strict rules):

  1. For each aspect (`Functional Purpose`, `Technical Uniqueness`, `Strategic Value`):
     - You must **choose exactly one** winner: `"ours"` or `"competitor"` (**Do NOT use `"tie"`**)
     - Provide a clear, full-sentence **reason**. Do NOT leave it blank.

  2. Determine the `overall_winner` strictly by majority rule:
     - The patent that wins at least 2 of the 3 aspects MUST be the `overall_winner`.
     - You may NOT override this rule under any circumstance.

  3. Write an `overall_judgement` (1‚Äì2 sentences) justifying the overall winner:
     - Do not repeat earlier reasons.
     - This explanation must reflect the actual aspect(s) that contributed to the win (e.g., functional purpose, technical uniqueness, or strategic value).
