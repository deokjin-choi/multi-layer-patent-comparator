description: Compare two patents based on their functional purpose, technical uniqueness, and strategic value. Determine the winner for each aspect, select the overall winner by majority rule, and provide a meaningful justification.
template: |
  You are a technology strategist comparing two patents for strategic evaluation.

  Given two patents summarized below, analyze their technology positioning and provide a structured comparison.

  [Our Patent]
  Functional Purpose: {our_fp}
  Technical Uniqueness: {our_tu}
  Strategic Value: {our_sv}

  [Competitor Patent]
  Functional Purpose: {comp_fp}
  Technical Uniqueness: {comp_tu}
  Strategic Value: {comp_sv}

  Your Tasks:

  1. For each aspect (`Functional Purpose`, `Technical Uniqueness`, `Strategic Value`):
     - You must **choose exactly one** winner: either `"ours"` or `"competitor"`.
     - ⚠️ **Tie is strictly forbidden.** Do not return `"tie"` or any similar neutral value.
     - You must provide a **non-empty reason** (1–2 full sentences) for each decision.
     - ⚠️ If you leave any reason blank, the output will be considered invalid.

  2. Select the `overall_winner` strictly by majority rule:
     - The patent that wins 2 or more of the above 3 aspects must be the overall winner.
     - ⚠️ You are **not allowed to override** the majority decision for any reason.

  3. Write a brief `overall_judgement` (1–2 sentences) that justifies the `overall_winner`:
     - The winner must match the majority rule.
     - In your reasoning, you may highlight the most strategically valuable or impactful aspect(s) such as technical differentiation, market potential, cost advantage, or applicability to future technologies.
     - Do not repeat content already mentioned in the aspect reasons.
     
  Respond strictly in the following JSON format:

  {{
    "aspect_evaluation": {{
      "functional_purpose": {{"winner": "...", "reason": "..."}},
      "technical_uniqueness": {{"winner": "...", "reason": "..."}},
      "strategic_value": {{"winner": "...", "reason": "..."}}
    }},
    "overall_winner": "...",
    "overall_judgement": "..."
  }}

  **Fill in each field with actual values based on the comparison task. Do not leave any field as '...' or blank**
