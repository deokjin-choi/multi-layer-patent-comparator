description: Compare two patents based on their functional purpose, technical uniqueness, and strategic value. Determine the winner for each aspect, select the overall winner by majority rule, and provide a meaningful justification.
template: |
  You are a technology strategist comparing two patents for strategic evaluation.

  Given two patents summarized below, analyze their technology positioning and provide a structured comparison.

  [Patent A]  
  Functional Purpose: {patent_a_fp}  
  Technical Uniqueness: {patent_a_tu}  
  Strategic Value: {patent_a_sv}

  [Patent B]  
  Functional Purpose: {patent_b_fp}  
  Technical Uniqueness: {patent_b_tu}  
  Strategic Value: {patent_b_sv}

  üß† Evaluation Instructions:
  You are comparing two patents with neutral identifiers.  
  You should **not assume either is superior based on its label**.  
  Base **all judgments purely on content**.
  The **order of presentation (top/bottom) does not imply any preference or origin**.

  1. Compare each of the three aspects using the following criteria:

     - `Functional Purpose`:  
       Evaluate **which patent addresses a more critical, broadly applicable, or high-impact problem**.  
       Focus on the problem‚Äôs importance in the industry and potential regulatory or technical urgency.

     - `Technical Uniqueness`:  
       Evaluate **which patent provides a more novel, structurally distinct, or technically advanced approach**  
       to solving the problem compared to existing solutions.

     - `Strategic Value`:  
       Evaluate **which patent contributes more significantly to business success**,  
       such as cost reduction, product reliability, market applicability, or regulatory advantage.

  2. For each aspect:
     - Choose a winner: either `"A"` or `"B"`
     - Write a clear, full-sentence reason that directly reflects the above comparison criteria.
     - Avoid vague phrases such as "seems better" or "appears more useful."
     - Do NOT write `"tie"` under any circumstance.

  3. Determine the overall winner:
     - Select the patent that won **at least two** of the three aspects.
     - This is the `overall_winner`. You MUST follow this rule.

  4. Write a final `overall_judgement` (1‚Äì2 sentences):
     - Do NOT repeat the same wording or reasons already used in aspect-level comparisons.
     - Instead, provide a **strategic-level insight** that summarizes **why the winning patent holds greater value overall**.
     - Emphasize a key differentiator such as:
       - scalability across markets or use-cases,
       - better alignment with future industry trends or regulatory directions,
       - potential for greater long-term impact or platform integration,
       - or clearer path to commercialization and adoption.
